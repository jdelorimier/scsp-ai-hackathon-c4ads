They come from a spectacular crescent made up of 4,351 cattle skulls south of Grave 253, dated to the Kerma Moyen period (2050-1750 nc) (see fig. 54). Cattle skulls were carved in order to preserve only the frontal part and the horns. At the end of the Kerma Ancien period, the carving preserved the nasal bones, while later the skull was cut near the nasal spine, During the Kerma Clas- sique period bucrania were reduced to the highest part of the frontal and the two horns. The skin was removed as attested by numer- ous tracks of knives or razors (Chaix 1993). Sometimes bucrania were decorated with red patches (cat. 71b) or entirely painted with red ochre, The deposition of bucrania, always in the southern part of the tumuli, began at the end of the Kerma Ancien culture with an acme during the Kerma Moyen period, declining in the Kerma Classique. The number of bucrania is linked with the social importance of the deceased and the size of the grave. The composition of an assemblage does not reflect a living herd. The proportion of the various categories (bulls, cows, calves and oxen) differs from a natural cattle herd. The disposition of the bucrania follows precise rules: in the front a row of cows, often accompanied by young calves; behind, a row of bulls, followed by a row of oxen. This arrangement may be repeated many times as shown in Grave 253 where forty rows of skulls were discovered (Chaix 1996). In the graves of important persons there are bucrania with strong deformation of the horns that have been forced to grow parallel as illustrated by the bucranium shown here (cat. 71¢; Chaix 2001). The bucranium of the calf shows a bulb at the tip of the left horn (cat. 71d). This feature can be linked with a future deformation of the horns. The bucra- nia with parallel horns form many rows intermixed with the normal ones. This man-made deformation is similar to those currently practised in the southern Sudan (Murle) and in’ the Ethiopia (Turkana), Saharan prehistoric rock art also north of presents numerous cattle with horns pointing forward, The significance of such a deforma- tion remains unknown, LC Chaix 1993, 175-85; 1996, 95-7; 2001, 364-70 SUDAN: ANCIENT TREASURES a> re 4"

W 270 mm, Th } 17mm SNM 18 A round-topped stela, in good condition, missing only a section of the bottom left-hand corner. The body of the stela bears an incised hieroglyphic inscription, arranged in ten hor- izontal lines, the signs reading from right to left. The lunette is decorated, in sunk relief, With a religious motif in the form of the so- called shen-ring flanked by two udjat eyes. Both the motif and the inscription were fin- ished in green paint, substantial traces of which remain. The text reads: ‘(1) A gift that the king gives (to) Osiris, Lord of Busiris, the Great God, Lord of Abydos, (2) and (to) Horus, Lord of Foreign Land{s}, that they may give an invocation offering consisting of bread and beer, oxen and fowl, and all things (3) good and pure, on which a god lives, which heaven creates and (4) earth makes, which Hapy (the Nile Indundation) brings as his per- fect offering, for the spirit (5) of the nobleman Ka, It is the son of his daughter who makes his name to live, (6) namely the nobleman Tah-user. He (Ka) says: I was a valiant servant (7) of the ruler of Kush. I washed my feet (8) in the waters of Kush in the following of the (9) ruler Nedjeh. [ returned (10) safe and sound (and) my family (too).’ During the Middle Kingdom, the Egyptians invaded and occupied Lower Nubia (the land of Wawat), establishing a new southern border upstream of the Second Cataract. Buhen was one of a chain of great fortresses which they built along the Nile in Wawat to consolidate and extend their economic interests and to police the native population. The major aims were to control the rich goldmines of Nubia’s Eastern Desert and the trade in African goods with lands further to the south. Towards the end of the 13th Dynasty (1795-1650 BC), Egypt underwent a great political upheaval and, among other consequences, was obliged to withdraw from Nubia. In the north a Canaanite dynasty, known as the Hyksos, took control of the Nile Delta and Lower Egypt. In the south Wawat and the fortresses, among them Buhen, were occupied by the forces of the powerful kingdom of Kush, based at Kerma just south of the Third Cataract. It appears that not all Egyptian personnel chose to flee. Some remained to serve the new masters. This stela is one of a group of monuments from Buhen belonging to a single family who administered the fortress over several genera- tions during the period of Kushite rule. A high official named Ka was the owner of the stela, which was dedicated to him by his grandson, also a high official, named Iah-user. We know from other sources that Ka was preceded in office by his father and grandfather, both named Sobekemheb. His younger brother, named Sepedhor, served as ‘commandant of Buhen’ and was instrumental in rebuilding the Temple of Horus at Buhen where their stelae were set up. Both proudly state that they served the ruler of Kush whose name is given on the stela of Ka as Nedjeh. There is insuffi- cient data to decide on the precise dates of Ka and Sepedhor, and of the Kushite king in ques- tion, but the latter is perhaps to be identified as the owner of one or other of the two latest tumuli in the royal cemetery at Kerma, desig- nated as K.IV and K.III respectively, which are roughly contemporary with the mid- to late 17th Dynasty (1650-1550 be) in Egypt.

It is decorated in sunk relief, with @ --- Page 104 --- somewhat schematic figure of a king shown as if striding to the right. He wears the white crown of Upper Egypt with a uraeus at the forehead and a short skirt with a protruding front, probably a version of the royal shendyt- kilt. In his rear hand he holds a mace, and in his front hand a long, double-curved bow and three arrows. The body of the figure was painted red, his kilt and crown white. There are good grounds, both stylistic and archaeological, for identifying the figure as one of the kings of Kush, shown as having ‘adopted in part at least the regalia of Pharaoh, specifically as king of Upper Egypt’ (Smith 1976, 12). This was no empty aspira- tion on the part of the Kushites. During the Kerma Classique period they not only ruled the whole of Nubia but also carried out at least one substantial invasion of Upper Egypt (cat. 75). It has been suggested that the king repre- sented here may be the Nedjeh mentioned on the Buhen stela of Ka (cat. 73). wvD Berenguer 2003c; Morkot 2000, 68, fig. 32; Smith 1976, 11-12, no. 691, 84, 246, pls iii, 2, lviii, 4; Soulé-Nan 2002, 161-2, fig. 31; Wildung 1997, 100, no. 100; Williams 199 1b, 80, 83, fig. 8a"

W 82.5 mm SNM 1087 Finely polished, bag-shaped flask with a ribbed neck associated, when found, with a lid made of serpentine, now lost. It has been very skilfully worked, with a vein in the stone exploited to great effect to form a decorative central band, separating the flasks upper and lower parts which are of different hues. Inside the flask there are substantial remains of its original contents, initial analysis! identifying it as a now-degraded oil of plant origin. The flask bears, incised on the exterior body, a rectangular frame enclosing a funer- ary inscription arranged in three columns of hieroglyphs, reading from right to left and down, identifying its contents and original owner: A gift which [the king] gives, that he may give incense and unguent to the spirit of the Governor, Hereditary Prince, of Nekhen (Hierakonpolis), Sobeknakht.’ This flask is one of a substantial number of SUDAN: ANCIENT TREASURES Egyptian objects buried in the royal tumuli at Kerma, in this case in an elite subsidiary grave within the precincts of Tumulus K.II, the last of the great tumuli in the Eastern Cemetery. The original source of the flask would have been the Egyptian owner’s tomb presumably located at Hierakonpolis (though not impossi- bly perhaps at ElKab), from which it was proba- bly plundered during a Kushite raid on the region. There are several other objects origi- nally from Hierakonpolis among the Kerma material. That such raids took place is con- firmed by an inscription recently discovered (Davies 2003a, d and e) in the tomb of another Sobeknakht, a governor of ElKab, the twin- town of Hierakonpolis, during the 17th Dynasty, who may well have been related to his namesake across the river. It records the occur- rence of a major Kushite attack on Upper Egypt during his governorship, one of the main aims of which was to secure booty (the aggressors are referred to in the inscription as ‘looters’), much of it evidently destined for reuse and deposition at Kerma.

New Kingdom, 18th Dynasty (co-regency of Hatshepsut/Thutmose III) Buhen H 220mm, W 124mm,.Th 650mm SNM 92 Figure of a man, identified by inscription as the ‘Scribe Amenemhat’, in the pose of squat- ting, his knees drawn up before him, on a pedestal with straight sides and a rounded front and back. The piece is finely sculpted and in very good condition. Amenemhat is represented as wearing a long, broad, shoulder-length wig, a short beard and a tight-fitting cloak that envelops his body, except for the arms shown emerging just in front of the knees, the right crossed over the left, with the right hand clenched, the left extended palm-downwards. His face is broad and triangular in shape and his expres- sion benign. The eyes, asymmetrically posi- tioned, are large, wide-open and slope markedly inwards, the eyebrows and cos- metic lines rendered as raised bands. The nose is relatively narrow and pointed at the end. The mouth, with two thick lips, is small with just the hint of a smile. The ears, set high, are large and splay slightly against the wings of the headdress. The treatment over- all, and particularly of the eyes, is evocative of that of royal portraiture of the period. Incised between the knees and legs, on the front of the figure, is a hieroglyphic inscription arranged in four columns, reading from right to left and top to bottom: ‘Gift that the king gives (to) Horus, Lord of Buhen, that he may give invocation offerings consisting of bread, beer, oxen, fowl, alabaster, linen, incense, unguents, all things good and pure, offerings of every vegetable, that upon which a god lives, every- thing which comes forth upon his offering table regularly every day, for the spirit of the scribe Amenemhat, repeating life, possessor of veneration’. Further, single columns of inscrip- tion are located towards the rear of the figure, on the right and left sides respectively and on the rear itself. The side inscriptions repeat the owner's title and name and also identify his parents. The column on the figure’s right side reads (from right to left and down) ‘Scribe Amenemhat, begotten of the chief of Teh-khet Rwiw [mis-spelt as Rwsw]’, that on the left (from left to right and down) ‘Scribe Amen- emhat, born to the mistress of the house, Rwna’. The column on the rear reads ‘Revered [before] Osiris, Scribe Amen- emhat, justified’. In form and style, <is is a typical ‘block- statue’ of the early {2th Dynasty, a dating confirmed by the identity of the owner and his parents, who are known from other monu- ments of the period (cf. cat. 78). It was found buried as one of a cache of three statuettes, one of the others also belonging to the same Amenemhat (now Philadelphia E 10980). Originally placed in one of the temples of Horus at Buhen, they were probably removed and buried during the 18th Dynasty before the Amarna Period, as on both figures of Amen- emhat, the name element Amen’ has been left untouched, suggesting that the pieces were inaccessible to Akhenaton’s agents.

The surface of its back is well polished. Details of the insect's body are represented by incised lines. On the flat side a hieroglyphic text runs horizontally from right to left, giving the name and title of the deceased and the beginning of Chapter 30B of the Book of the Dead. This object was part of the funerary equipment of an undisturbed burial, found in a secondary subterranean room of the tomb. It was located on the breast, over the position of the heart. When mummification was per- formed, the heart was generally kept inside the body. However, very often a stone amulet was added, first shaped in the form of the ancient Egyptian’s conventional representa- tion of the heart in hieroglyphic writing, and from the 18th Dynasty, in the form of a large scarab, one of the forms of the god Ra, named Khepri. Several spells of the Book of the Dead, Chapters 26-9, were intended to prevent the heart of a man from being stolen after his death. In Chapter 30B, used here, the heart itself, regarded as a real being, is called out not to testify against its owner at the moment of the Judgement. SUDAN: ANCIENT TREASURES A very similar heart scarab, now in the Cairo Museum, was discovered about fifty years ago by Steindorff in a New Kingdom tomb at Aniba, the most important site in Lower Nubia at this period (Steindorff 1937, 14, 88, 240-41 and pl. 48).

The head, sculpted in the round, represents a face with heavy features, surrounded by a short wig. The mixed form of this funerary amulet — the simple scarab and the ba-bird with human head — is one of the multiple aspects taken by the so-called ‘heart scarab’. All of them served the same function, revealed by the presence of the text of Chapter 30B of the Book of the Dead on similar inscribed objects. The present item is uninscribed. It was found in a subsidiary room of the tomb, on the chest of an aged man whose funerary equipment included an inscribed shabti bearing his name, a little scarab with royal iconography (cat. 94) and a ring (cat. 88). Its position, higher than the associated bones, suggests that the amulet was placed above the coffin and not inside, as was usually the case. Such human-headed heart scarabs are rather uncommon. A few others have been discovered in the same necropolis of Sai. as well as in the New Kingdom cemetery of Aniba in Lower Nubia (Steindorff 1937. pl. 48, no. 18; pl. 49, nos 20, 21).

With the other hand he grips a 91, bottom right; 92, bottom left; 93, top right; 94, top left bound prisoner whose hands are tied behind his back. Protruding above the king's fore- head, we can see the most common attribute of divine and royal figures, the rearing cobra — the uraeus — connected with the cobra- goddess Wadjyt.

It seems that the first appearance of this theme might be dated to Thutmose III, a king who greatly enlarged Egyptian territory during the 18th Dynasty. During the next dynasty, this motif was reused significantly by another conquering king, Ramesses II. FT 119 --- Page 121 --- 120 SUDAN? ANCIENT TREASURES 95,96"

It is part of the category of pottery figure vases in moulded terracotta studied by J. Bourriau (1987, 85) and dated to the 18th Dynasty (from the beginning until Thutmose Ill). The fabric is fine, covered with a burnished red slip with details represented in black pigment. The body is made in two moulded parts joined manually; the dorsal and caudal fins were then added. The collar is represented by the open mouth of the fish. The vase was empty, without traces of any content. This fish is the tilapia nilotica that is so often represented, notably with lotuses in cups of blue faience, It has its place in a funeral context because it is a symbol of revival (Dambach and Wallert 1966, 276, 283-94. Desroches-Noblecourt 1954, 33-42). Well-known parallels offer variations in details and quality (Bourriau 1987, 89-90). In the context of the eastern cemetery of Deir el-Medina from where vases of the same group come, it was recently proposed that they would have belonged to members of the middle class (Pierrat-Bonnefois 2003, 59). In Nubia, however, such a vase would most likely have been seen as a luxury item. AM-G"

It is also datable to the first half of the 18th Dynasty. The fabric is the same and it is cov- ered with the same red burnished slip, par- tially crackled. Its decoration is applied in black lines: the frieze of triangles on the lip, the horizontal line at the base of the collar, the sheets of palm stylized on the belly of the vessel, and the grids hung as nets on the han- dles. The shape of the vase was perhaps inspired by contemporary Cypriot vases, but it is incontestably Egyptian from Nubia, and illustrates that which J. ourriau (1987, 82-3) calls ‘a foreign fallacy’, in reference to the tendency of twentieth-century scholars to attribute to foreign (north and east) coun- tries all that was good and original in Egypt- ian pottery. This shape of amphora seems to appear during the reign of Hatshepsut aud lasts up to the Amarna period (Bourriau 1982b, 127). AM-G"

Kohl pots intended as containers or for the preparation of cosmetics could, like these, be made of Egyptian alabaster (calcite), but they could also be made from other stones, or wood, faience or ivory. They are frequently part of the equipment in Egyptian tombs (Vandier d'Abbadie 1972, 85-7). Kohl was used by both men and women to protect and outline the eyes. Black koh! was made from crushed galena and green kohl from malachite. Kohl, in a funerary context, was important because of — --- Page 122 --- 97a-d its use as make-up — notably, to the Eye of Horus which is referred to as early as the Pyra- mid Texts. The offering of make-up was equiva- lent to the offering of the Eye of Horus itself, and this was the symbol of resurrection (Troy 1991, 151). Moreover, kohl pots are often found close to the body of the deceased. The use of kohl pots becomes frequent in the Middle Kingdom. The three examples here are of a type that was current in the New Kingdom. These small vases are of a wide and squat shape and fit well within the hand. They have not retained any traces of contents, nor of any lid, and no pestle was found with them. The small cup doubtless served as a palette for the preparation of the make-up, although no residue of colour gives evidence of its use. AM-G"

Another mask, in plaster, from SUDAN: ANCIENT TREASURES the same cemetery is also presented here (cat. 288). The mask is of beautiful work, and made from a well-fired fabric. The face is triangular and finely featured. The eyes are almond- shaped, with the outline incised and the interior in relief; the eyebrows are very long and extend towards the temples; the nose and the lips are in relief, with a sharp profile. The lower half of the face is damaged: the top of the nose, the lips and the chin are worn but the features are preserved as well as a sweet smile similar to that of a kore; the reverse is slightly concave. The mask was placed directly on the face of the deceased and fixed with linen or stucco which completely enveloped the body. Such masks were moulded, painted and often covered with a golden sheet (Troy 1991, 65). Masks in stucco or terracotta are well known in the Nubian New Kingdom cemeter- ies, notably in Sai, in the cemeteries exca- vated by the Scandinavian expedition near the Second Cataract (Troy 1991, 64), Buhen (Randall-Maclver and Woolley 1911, 142, pl. 61) and in Aniba (Steindorff 1937, 73-4). Steindorff speculates that their small size was governed by the need of the Egyptian officials to transport them. Their latest use, in both Egypt and Nubia, dates to the end of the 18th or beginning of the 19th Dynasty (Troy 1991, 65).

This type of amphora derives its shape from the Levantine amphorae of the Late Bronze Age I. It became extremely popu- lar in Egypt where over time it developed a tapering body and pronounced shoulders (Hope 1989, 93). It is possible that it con- tained wine. This hypothesis is confirmed by the presence next to the amphora of the bronze point of a siphon which was used to filter the impurities from the wine. Such a use is well illustrated on a well-known stela from el-Amarna, showing a Syrian man drinking wine from a similar type of amphora.

A green glass pendant amulet in the shape of an enthroned Isis suckling Horus was found in the filling of the first chamber, in a dis- turbed layer, but its miniaturized form sug- gests a possible dating to the most recent phase of use of the tomb (25th Dynasty).

The head was discovered by Griffith during the excavation of the Temple of Amun (Temple T) in the south-east corner of the First Court. Its facial features are consistent with the iconography of Tahargo (cf. fig. ¥8),! and it almost cer- tainly dates to his reign, 690-664 BC, as is highly likely in any event from the context. It is uncertain when the body of the statue was found: it was already in the Merowe Museum when the head was discovered. Ptah was the chief god of Memphis, the patron deity of artists, craftsmen and builders. By the time of the construction of the Temple of Amun at Kawa, Memphis had been the de facto capital of Kush for a quarter of a century. The Memphite god Ptah was especially venerated by the Kushites and he is frequently depicted within the Kawa temple where he appears to have had a popular cult (for the importance of Ptah at Kawa see Térdk 2002, 89 ff.).

In the ‘centre’ of the cone are impressions perhaps of the pottery vessel, with a rim diameter of approximately 80 mm, which it was designed to seal. It bears one complete and two partial seal impressions, The complete example is rectangular, 22 X 30 mm in size, and depicts two tall jars on jar- stands flanking a small vessel with a plant motif (palm fronds?) above. The central part of the sealing appears to have been left blank. The other two seal impressions are identical. In the upper part of the impression is a hip- popotamus facing right, standing on a ground line beneath which is a crocodile also facing right, again on a ground line. The lower part of the impression is a mirror image of the upper. The decoration is enclosed by a narrow raised oval border. Each impression was origi- nally 68 mm high by approximately 50 mm wide and is much larger than the norm. Many seals bearing these stamp impres- sions were found immediately outside the south wall of Building Z1, the function of which is unknown. Sealings of mud were attached to a wide range of objects and on occasion record information concern- ing the material being traded, transported or stored, its provenance, the name of the official dealing with the consignment or of the ruling king. They were also used to seal doorways. The meaning of this sealing is unknown but its presence along with many other examples probably indicates that con- tainers were being brought to Building Z1 where their contents were used, repacked or placed in storage. Here the sealings were dis- carded outside the building while elsewhere at Kawa (in Building Al) and at Jebel Barkal the sealings were kept, presumably as an administrative record (for Jebel Barkal see Vincentelli 1993).

The face is broad and is dominated by the short nose, with widely flared nostrils and small nostril open- ings. The mouth, as wide as the nose, has markedly protruding, almost pouting, thin lips which are not quite closed, revealing a row of rectangular teeth. The large almond- shaped eyes are not clearly differentiated from the cheeks along their lower edge but the upper lids are prominent. The eyebrows are represented by four grooves over the left eye and by three grooves over the right eye. The ears, which stick out at right angles from the head, are semi-circular with a deep semi- circular depression against the side of the head and two concentric grooves towards the edge of the earlobes. The outer groove is pierced by two circular holes. The pert breasts have prominent circular nipples with a depression in the centre, and there is a deep circ:::s: navel in the trim stomach. The pubic hair is indicated by short incised lines arranged in several horizontal rows, and with an oblique row delimiting the hair towards each thigh. A vertical groove indicates the vulva. The legs are bowed with no indication of knees and the feet are small and stubby. The arms are arranged symmet- rically with the hands resting on the sides of the legs adjacent to where the knees should be. Grasped in the poorly formed right hand and held against the lower arm is a straight- bladed dagger with a pronounced median rib. The neck of a snake is held in the left hand and the sinuous body tapering into the tail extends up the arm to the neck. The snake's head is held tight against the side of the leg. Crowning the head is a large flaring feather headdress of four plumes, the median rib and the tines indicated by shallow and narrow incised grooves. The sides of the headdress round into the top which, although damaged, appears to be slightly concave towards the centre. Nine holes survive close to the top edge of the headdress. At the base of the headdress a line of short vertical grooves presumably represents the hair, the same method used to depict the pubic hair. The whole of the front and sides of the figure is covered in whitewash, overlain in places by traces of paint in other colours. The poor preservation of the painted surface makes it difficult to reconstruct the original decoration. Fragments of yellow are visible particularly on the thighs, lower torso, shoul- ders, around the edge of the earlobes and at the base of the headdress above the left eye- brow. The pubic hair is picked out in black. The left shoulder has an area decorated by large black and white dots on the yellow back- ground. This may represent a leopard skin draped over the shoulder and from the lower edge of the yellow are rectangular stripes which may represent tassels. Similar stripes are visible hanging down on the lower left leg. Some of the grooves on the headdress are filled with red paint and part of the surface is yellow, The snake along the left arm is picked out in red and the upper two grooves of the left eyebrow are filled with red paint. The rear of the statue is flat and was clearly not meant to be seen, although it is also covered in white- wash. The base, which tapers from front to back, extended 100 mm beyond the back of the statue and had presumably been set into a wall, the statue standing flush against the wall face. This may explain the absence of a tail, --- Page 158 --- The .::.°22 exhibits many of the characteris- tics of i: setter known representations of Bes (cf. cats 166, 285), but whereas there is often some sexual ambiguity with Bes figures, the Kawa piece is unashamedly female. A number of gods are represented in the visual form usu- ally associated with Bes, among them Aha and Hayt (Romero 1989, 14). If a similar situation pertains to the female form the identification of the Kawa statuette with Beset may not be strictly correct. The existence of the female form has been doubted (ibid., 16-17), but the gender of the Kawa piece calls for a reconsider- ation of the evidence.! Representations of Beset are known as early as the Middle King- dom but only become frequent in the Ptole- maic period. Beset is regarded as the mother of Bes, sometimes depicted suckling him, but also as his consort (Altenmiiller 1975). The Kawa statue was found broken into many pieces and scattered in a number of rubbish deposits immediately outside Build- ing Al (see Welsby 2001a). Some of the breaks were of very recent date, probably caused when it was being dug out of the ground immediately prior to the commence- ment of excavations on the site in 1998. The form of the piece clearly indicates that it was designed to be set into a wall although total excavation of Building Al failed to find any evidence for where it might have stood. DAW"

The facial features are very similar to those of cat. 142, although the eyebrows are even more prominent, with five clear almost horizontal ridges above each eye and the tongue is shown sticking out. The one surviv- ing ear is not pierced. Only the lower part of the feather headdress survives and the tip of the dagger or sword held across the chest in the right hand. This is clearly a representation of Bes and forms a pair with the Beset statue. Like Beset, the back is flat and was presumably affixed to a wall. Fragments of two other statues of the same type were recovered from this area and ongoing excavations may be expected to reveal more fragments, if not more figures. The Bes figure was recovered lying face-down on the sand which had begun to accumulate on the brick floor within Room IV of Building Al.

This is the site of the ancient city of Napata, whose ruins, largely unexcavated, extend in three directions around the steep sides of the small table mountain known as Jebel Barkal, which stands 2 km from the right bank of the Nile (fig. 117). The site was first noted and described by G. Wadding- ton and B. Hanbury in 1822, and by F. Cailliaud who accompanied the Egyptian army of Muhammed Ali on its invasion of the Sudan in 1820-21. It was Cailliaud who first recognized the site as Napata.! To these and the few other Western explorers of the early nineteenth century, Napata was known only from classical texts as the residence of the ruling queen of Meroe, when in 24 8c it was attacked by a Roman army.

The double uraeus identifies the work as Kushite. The sphinx’s forelegs terminate in human arms and hands, which hold an offering jar on which are inscribed the king's names in a double cartouche: Sekheper-en- Re Senkamenisken.

During clearing of the first court of the Great Amun Temple at Jebel Barkal in Janu- ary 1920, Reisner found this sphinx just inside the entrance, facing the temple axis. Just beside it was a small granite stand, inscribed for Atlanersa, on which rested a seated statue of Thutmose III in Heb-Sed robes (Dunham 1970, pl. IVA).

The rondel has been reconstructed. These plaques, and others of various shapes and colours, decorated the exterior of Natakamani’s palace at Jebel Barkal where they had been set into the wall plaster (Donodoni 1993, 102-103, 110; 1994, 56). Similar tondi were used in the decoration of the so-called ‘Royal Baths’ (M 195) at Meroe where they were set in the edge above the basin alternating with statu- ary and other plaques (Térdk 1997b, 75-7. pls 28-34). There, it has been suggested that they may have depicted Maenads, the frenzied women of the Dionysian cult, and formed part of an iconographic programme relating to the use of the baths as a water sanctuary with Dionysian characteristics as derived from the Dionysian cults of Ptolemaic Egypt (Tor6k 1997b, 76-7). The reason for the employ- ment of such a motif on the exterior of a royal palace remains uncertain; however, it may reflect the attribution of some characteristics of the god Dionysos to the Kushite ruler or his attempt to portray himself as a Dionysiac king, as was common among the Ptolemaic pharaohs, most notably Ptolemy IV (cf. Haz- zard 2000, 115-16). JRA"

The scene shows on the right a standing figure of King Piankhi (Piye) (747-716 Bc), identified in the cartouche above him, wear- ing the characteristic Kushite cap-crown with double uraci, facing left and offering a pec- toral and a necklace to a triad of deities (a form of the traditional Theban triad), an enthroned Amen-Ra, followed by a standing Mut and Khons, all facing right. The deities are rendered in raised relief, as was the origi- nal (taller) figure of the king, which was removed (together with his name) at some time after the completion of the stela and then later restored in incised work. The king’s prenomen and nomen were systematically removed wherever they occurred on the stela. Amen-Ra or Amun, shown in his Nubian, ram-headed form, presents to the king the crowns of Egypt and Kush, the red crown of Lower Egypt in his left hand, the Kushite cap- crown in his right (replacing here the tradi- tional white crown of Upper Egypt), signifying a unified kingship and legitimate Kushite dominion over Egypt. Divine sanction of Piankhi’s ascent to the throne is confirmed in the god’s address ‘to his son, whom he loves’. inscribed in the columns of inscription above him: ‘I said concerning you (even when you were still) in the womb of your mother, that you would be ruler of Egypt ... I caused you to receive the Great Crown ... It is I who decreed (the kingship) for you ... No other may decree (who shall be) king’. The king’s acknowledge- ment is recorded in the columns behind him, where he asserts his pre-eminence over all other rulers: Amun of Napata has caused me to be ruler of all foreign countries. To whomso- ever I say “you are chief”, he shall be chief. To whomsoever I say “You are not king”, he shall not be king. Amun in Thebes has caused me to be ruler of Egypt. To whomsoever I say “Make your appearance (as king)”, he shall make his appearance. To whomsoever I say “Do not make appearance”, he shall not make his appearance ... Gods make a king, men make a king, (But) it is Amun who has made me’. The main text of the stela is located directly beneath the offering scene. Arranged in hori- zontal lines reading right to left and down- wards, it records the king's full titulary and epithets, and once continued with a historical narrative, of which only fragments of the beginning now survive. One of these frag- ments crucially bears the remnants of what may be a year date, possibly to be read as ‘(regnal-year) 3’, in which case the stela is Piankhi's earliest known monument. Piankhi’s titulary was clearly inspired by that of one of his great imperial ‘predeces- sors’, King Thutmose III of the 18th Dynasty. as recorded on the latter’s famous victory stela from Jebel Barkal. One especially signifi- cant difference, however. is the form of the king's so-called Horus-name. In the case of Thutmose III, the name is ‘Strong Bull.

The drilled eyes were once inlaid. The round support on the head has a rectangular socket that would probably have supported a gilt copper-alloy crown of a pair of tall feathers and sun disc with uraeus. The small Amun Temple B 700 at Barkal was built so close to the mountain that it was repeatedly damaged by falls of rock from the cliff. Founded by Atlanersa in the mid-seventh century sc, the temple was completed by Senkamanisken after his predecessor’s pre- mature death. Thenceforth it seems to have served the royal mortuary cult, for the ruins contained small copper-alloy Osiride figures as well as fragments of a large false door of the deceased Atlanersa. When Reisner began clearing the ruins in March 1916, he found the second chamber (B 703) buried under huge rocks. Breaking them up, he was able to expose not only the rest of the room and the fine bark stand of Senkamanisken, now in Boston (Dunham 1970, pls XXX—XXXI), but also a tiny sanctu- ary (B 704) in its rear wall that still contained a small granite altar and a trove of statues. The main figures were this image of Amun, @ fine standing statue of Amenhotep III (ibid.. pls V-VI), and a badly decayed sandstone seated statue of a Kushite king (ibid., pl. LVI) The reused masonry of B 703 revealed that the rear of the temple had been destroyed and rebuilt in the later Napatan or Meroitic period. The small sanctuary B 704 belonged to this later phase, which meant that all the contents had been placed there after it was built, probably after the fourth century BC- The Amun statue was perhaps made as the temple's new cult image.

It was found in 2000 by the Sudanese-Canadian team conducting a surface survey at Meroe. Along both edges of the block two double lines are incised, enclosing an inscription containing a royal name written within a cartouche. Above the cartouche but below the break are two hieroglyphs, the t signs, presumably representing the nsw-bity (king of Upper and Lower Egypt) title - the prenomen. Within the cartouche the signs Imn-in are fully preserved, and a small depression just above the break point is clearly the head of a lion - the I sign. There can be little doubt that the name should be read Imn-Inl, that is, Anlamani, but this is a little unusual as this name normally follows the Son of Ra title. Although examples of Napatan kings using two different titles for the same name are known, this has not been documented with Anlamani thus far. At the south end of M 295 Garstang apparently found a similar architectural fragment bearing the name of the fifth-century ec king Talakhamani (Térdk 1997b, 167, no. 295-1 = insc, 97, fig. 125). Although the first three signs of both royal names (Imn = Amani) are identical, others are not, and therefore Anlamani's inscription comes from a different block, unless Garstang copied the text incorrectly and misread the name.

Bellow nozzles, or tuyéres, were used to force air into the chamber. They were cigar-shaped, hol- lowed inside, and tapered at both ends. They were made of the Nile silt formed round a wooden rod (Tylecote 1982, 30-32). During heating some of the slag remained on the bottom of the furnace, but most of the liquid slag was tapped away through the tap-hole. --- Page 170 --- Often solidified lumps of slag remained attached to the tuyére, as with the present example. Analysis of the iron contents in the ore and in slag suggests a yield of about 20 per cent of the iron in the ore (Tylecote 1982, 40). The presence of mounds of iron slag visible at Meroe and the nearby sites of Hamadab (Wolf 2002a, 93; 2002b, 109-10) and el-Hassa (Lenoble and Rondot 2003) suggests that this was an important indus- trial centre of the Kushite Meroitic kingdom. Iron used in the smelting presumably came from the sedimentary deposit of the ferrugi- nous sandstone common in this area. Remains of iron furnaces were excavated by Shinnie at Meroe (Shinnie and Kense 1982; Tylecote 1982),! enabling the reconstruction of the iron-smelting process. KG"

The ka was a kind of life force, a person's double that was born with them, but survived after death and could receive offerings for the deceased. Each side of the plaque bears an inscription giving the prenomen and nomen of King Aspelta (c. 593-568 nc): ‘King of Upper and Lower Egypt, Merikara, may he live forever’ and ‘Son of Ra’, Aspelta, may he live forever’ (Nagy 1997, 240, insc. 67a, fig. 123). The function of the object is uncertain and its pos- sible funerary meaning may suggest that it actually post-dates the reign of Aspelta. A similarly decorated but smaller and unin- scribed faience object from Sakkara was published as an amulet (Reisner 1907, 158, no. 12260, pl. XX).

Garstang’s excava- tions of the Royal City at Meroe. It is carved on a block of ferricrete sandstone and exhibits the remains of fourteen lines of Greek text, inscribed to a depth of 1 mm. It was first published by A.H. Sayce (1909) and has since been republished and reinterpreted several times.! Due to its fragmentary state of preservation, only a few facts are firmly established. The stone is part of a throne, a triumphal monument set up in Meroe by a ‘king of Aksum and Himyar’ (line 1) to mark his victory over the Kushites and the occupa- tion of their capital. Similar inscribed thrones set up by Aksumite rulers recording their victorious campaigns are known from Ethiopia. In line 2, the Aksumite war god Mahrem is referred to by his Greek name Ares. Mention is made of pillaging (line 4) and hostages (line 9). We hear about another king, presumably the king of Kush (line 7), and about a tribute imposed on the defeated Kushites (line 12). The figure in line 14 prob- ably indicates the regnal year of the king. It is uncertain whether the king who set up the throne is identical with the famous King Ezana, dating to before his conversion to Christianity (mid-fourth century), or if it was one of his predecessors.

The sides are decorated with moulded, wavy, ridge and groove motifs which run vertically from an incised line at the base to a groove just below the rolled rim. The inner surface is plain with a single deep groove running 4 mm below the rim. Two opposed flat, gilded handles project from the rim where they have been soldered into posi- tion. Each handle has a central panel which was decorated with a raised motif of ribboned vegetation; scrolls projecting on either side of this panel have stamped dots arranged as stylized flowers. The handle attachments terminate in birds’ heads, possibly ducks or geese, with gilded beaks and eyes. Below each handle is an oval, penannular ring, whose open ends point towards the vessel. The base has a foot-ring containing two concentric grooves; two smaller grooves surround the lathe scar. On either side of the smaller circles are scratched Meroitic owners’ marks, one depicting an acanthus leaf on a shield atop a sacrificial stand. 158 The porringer is of Italian manufacture and belongs to a common first-century ap type, but the angular profile and the low foot- ring may suggest that it is a second-century variant. Without exact dating evidence in the form of coins or scientific dating methods there will always be difficulties in being pre- cise as to the date of individual tombs such as that of Queen Amanikhatashan (currently dated to AD 62-85); however, as further information emerges from comparative sites regarding the possible dates of the objects found in the tombs, we are slowly edging towards a clearer understanding of the chronology.

In consequence, textual evidence cannot help us much in outlining the Structure of the religion of ancient Meroe: it is the language of art that all the more has to assume the essential role of communicating their religious ideas to us.

Its shape, propor- tions and dimensions are almost identical to three altars of King Natakamani and Queen Amanitore found by Richard Lepsius in 1844 in the ruins of a temple at Wad ban Naqa.! Under the cavetto cornice, the four sides of the altar are decorated in relief. The front side shows the falcon-headed Horus (left) and the ibis-headed Thoth (right) binding papyrus plants around the central hieroglyphic emblem ‘sema’. Above this sign two car- touches are placed, crowned by a sun disc and double ostrich feather. The left (north- ern) cartouche contains the name of King Natakamani, while the right (southern) one the name of Queen Amanitore. Both are written in Meroitic hieroglyphs. The hieroglyphic texts in the horizontal lines above the gods try to imitate Egyptian texts: ‘The lord of the eight, the lord of the divine word, given life’ and ‘The lord of Behedet, the great god, given life’ are familiar epithets of Thoth of Hermopolis and Horus of Edfu; but both texts are nothing but a poor graphic imitation of an original written in Egyptian. This original, an altar of King Atlanersa who lived 650 years before the erection of the Temple of Amun at Naga,? stood in Temple B700 at Jebel Barkal. The same motif is repeated on the rear of the altar (Wildung and Kroeper 2003), this time with Horus on the right and Thoth on the left side; the orientation of the cartouches follows the pattern of the front side with the king to the north and the queen to the south. Reliefs on the right and left sides of the bark stand are divided into two registers. Below, two Nile gods are binding the papyrus plants around the sema with the queen's second — Egyptian — name Meri-ka-ra on the south and the king's second — Egyptian — cartouche Kheper-ka-ra on the north. Above, on both sides, three kneeling male figures with raised arm, jackal-headed and falcon- headed, with the same Egyptian hieroglyphic text ‘the souls of Pe', are preceded by a kneeling figure of the king and the goddess Meret. This decoration is the standard iconog- raphy of bark stands in Egyptian temples since the New Kingdom. Egyptian iconography has become an expression of Kushite royal ideology: the uni- fication of Upper and Lower Egypt, symbol- ized by the sema motif (cf. motif on cat. 76), is the emblematic sign of political and cosmic order under the control of Kushite kingship. A close parallel to this decoration can be found on the altar in the Great Temple of SUDAN: ANCIENT TREASURES Amun in Meroe (M 260). In perfectly cut relief of a strong three-dimensional effect. these figures show a stylistic modification of the Egyptian prototype into a clearly Meroitic artistic expression with heavy limbs and coarse proportions. The Egyptian and the Meroitic elements merge in an artistic cre- ation in its own right. DW"

The woman on the right wears a short curled wig and a diadem with two uraei, crowned by the white and red crown. On her head a part of the claw of a falcon is preserved, enough to reconstruct the headdress typical for Apedemak's consort, the goddess Amesemi (cat, 163), a double falcon on a crescent. A garment with fringed sleeves, a broad collar and a bracelet complete her cos- tume. Her raised left hand presents the ankh sign to a person facing her; only the right hand of this figure is preserved. The extremely long fingernails of both persons are character- istic of women; therefore the figure on the left of the fragment mus: ve a queen. The ankh sign in the uppermost left corner of the frag- ment is attached to a curved line descending from above, most probably from a sceptre held over the queen by another figure on the extreme left, a god. The symmetrical composi- tion showed the queen between Amesemi and Apedemak. A stela found in the sanctuary of the Amun Temple at Naga (Carrier 2000 (REM 1293), 5-6, 26-7, figs 17-19) presents the same arrangement.

Both are wearing a close-fitting dress descending to the feet, a fringed scarf over the right shoulder, a broad collar and a round curled wig. Otherwise they are repre- sented in very different ways. The left figure has a slim, elegant body; the dress shows a fine pattern of diagonal stripes and dotted lines. A chin-band, an earring, an orna- mented diadem with uraeus and a crown consisting of a pair of falcons with sun-discs sitting on a crescent contrast with the pleated dress and the simple diadem of the extremely corpulent woman on the right. The inscriptions in Meroitic hieroglyphs identify the left figure as Amesemi, the divine consort of the lion god Apedemak (the first complete reference to this name) and the figure to the right as Amanishakheto (with- "" AAA PARD PENA 163: front out cartouche), the well-known Meroitic queen buried in Pyramid N.6 at Begrawiya. The goddess plays the active part: her right hand supports the elbow of the queen's right arm, raised in adoration of Amesemi; her left arm passes behind the queen, the left hand supports the neck of the queen, and a dotted line, starting at the tip of the forefinger, sur- rounds the head of the queen to her forehead. A chain consisting of tiny ankh signs extends from Amesemi's nose to the nose of Aman- ishakheto. This animation by the divine breath is illustrated in a similar way in the reliefs of the Lion Temple at Naga. The rear and the sides of the stela have fifteen lines of text in cursive Meroitic, topped on the rear by a line in Egyptian hieroglyphs without specific meaning.

The statue type goes back to the cube statue introduced into Egyptian sculpture at about 19 50 ac (cf. cat. 77) and frequently used — mainly as temple statues — until the Ptolemaic period; besides these statues from Naga, this type is other- wise not known in Meroitic art. The style of these small sculptures is also unparalleled. Sculpted in a local workshop, they do not correspond to the stylistic expression of Meroitic art as represented in relief and sculpture of the urban centres, and are unre- lated to Egyptian or Hellenistic influences, Their deeply ‘African’ expression relates them visually to sculptures in West Africa (Nok, Ife) and assigns them a place at the beginnings of African art. The function of these small block statues remains unclear. All of them show traces of rubbing and have lost the original surfaces on both sides. Most probably they were used in a ritual, where ground sandstone from these statues was produced for magical practices (cf. Traunecker 1987, 221-42).

The position of the hindlegs indicates its readiness to jump forward. In its reduction to the basic forms this highly expressive statue is a masterpiece not only of Meroitic sculpture, but of animal sculpture in general. The significance of this animal may be related to that of the frog in Egyptian religion, where it is connected with the primeval water, creation and birth. Frogs are a motif on painted Meroitic pottery (Wenig 1978b, 299, no. 255; Wildung 1997, 350, no. 412) and on late Meroitic bronze vessels (Wildung 1997, 384, no. 455); they take monumental dimensions in the frog statues from Basa.!_ DW"

Originally they belonged to the ram ma» statues, forming a monumental avenue in front of the temple. On all of these twelve statues (and on a thirteenth one behind the temple) the feet of the royal figures can still be seen between the forelegs of the rams. The prototype of these ram statues with royal figures in front can be found in Soleb, in the ram avenue of Amenhotep III. These rams, reused by King Taharko at Temple B 500 of Jebel Barkal, apparently served as direct models for the Naga rams — another case of the close connection between Naga and Napata (cat. 159). The king is represented in mummiform shape, wearing the nemes headdress (the only attestation in Meroitic art) and the royal beard, and holding in his fists the heqa- crook, the flail and an ankh-sceptre descend- ing to the feet. This iconography is the royal SUDAN: ANCIENT TREASURES version of the canonical appearance of the god Khonsu, the son of Amun. The close- fitting cap and side-plait of Khonsu are replaced by the nemes, thus making the king the son of Amun, protected by his father in animal form, Although all these statues belong to a uni- form complex representing the same person. King Natakamani, the workmanship and style of the faces is very variable, Different artists cover the stylistic range, from idealizing faces to a clearly ‘African’ expression.

Sovereigns’ pyramids of the imperial dynasty were probably all investi- gated in succession on four sites. Secondary pyramids and mastabas were also examined on these sites and in Lower Nubia, revealing numerous lower-ranking dignitaries, viceroys in particular. There is little hope of shedding more light on this chronology without further information concerning the empire’s political organization, the order and exact length of the reigns, vicissi- tudes caused by possible divisions and temporary extensions or successions. The chronology stops in the fourth century ap because the construction of pyramids in the southern capital ceased at this point. Victory texts found at Aksum and at Meroe (cat. 155) lead one to suppose that the Meroitic Empire was subjugated by the Aksumite Empire at this time and consequently its funerary tradition came to a halt. The two centuries preceding the Christianization of the Middle Nile attest to the dis- appearance of imperial pyramid necropolises and the substitution of several cemeter- ies with mounds of exceptional size. One may record at least fourteen such sites along the valley (fig. 130). Five are well known in the Nubian desert following the numerous Surveys and excavations upstream from Sadd el Ali (Aswan High Dam); all others in the Sahel await work with only rare and modest soundings undertaken hitherto. A royal chronology for Nubia was recently created for the fourth and fifth centuries ap."" In the richest provinces one may foresee the discovery of important necropolises, either now poorly known or as yet unknown. The poverty of the southern docu- mentation hinders any detailed description of the evolution of a unified Kushite Empire into the three kingdoms successively Christianized in the sixth century AD. THE PROBLEMATIC IDENTIFICATION OF PRE-CHRISTIAN SOVEREIGNTY Due to general pillaging, a funerary crown has never been found beneath a pyra- mid. Nevertheless, it is not difficult to recognize Kushite rulers’ graves. Qore and dignitaries maintained royal workshops (scribes, architects, masons, sculptors, painters, bronzesmiths, etc.) for the creation of royal propaganda. Dozens of inscriptions and representations from funerary chapel reliefs and objects buried in the graves name and depict sovereigns and dignitaries, and help us to reconstruct the hierarchy and the prosopography of the Empire. --- Page 188 ---"

The mane, which is indicated in low relief, terminates at the back in a knot, and between this and the ears is carved a large scarab with triple wings. There is a prominent collar around and below the face. A rectangular ‘apron’ covers the chest and upper front legs, decorated with a pectoral of seven strands of pendant beads. Above these are two cartouches 190 mm high containing text in Meroitic hieroglyphs: ‘The Lord of the Two Lands, the king ever-living Amanikhabale’. This lion, one of several found at Basa (see also cat. 2), came from the west side of the hafir where it was set on a pedestal made from two courses of red brick covered in plaster. The lion was a potent symbol of the might of the Kushite state, and is frequently associated with the ruler who sits on a lion throne and is accompanied by a lion mauling prisoners — as on the pylons of the Lion Temple at Naqa. The lion is also associated with one of the chief gods of the Kushite state, Apedemak, who is fre- quently shown as a lion-headed human figure. Apedemak was the Kushite god of war and also of fertility. In this guise his presence at a hafir is very appropriate. Hafirs were presumably con- structed by the Kushite state to provide water for the transhuming and nomadic populations of the Keraba and Butana. After the wet season, when surface water became scarce, these people would have been forced to congregate with their animals at the hafirs. The lion statues and the nearby temple will have demonstrated to them the power and might of the state, and presumably the state would have taken the opportunity to tax them at this point. = DAW Crowfoot 1911, 14-17, pl.

The site was discovered in 1993 by a Sudan Archaeological Research Society (SARS) survey team directed by Michael Mallinson and Laurence Smith. With the encouragement of the Sudan National Corporation for Antiquities and Museums, SARS undertook a large-scale rescue excavation during the winter of 1994-5, prior to the construction of a new highway across the site. The Post-Meroitic component of this large and well-preserved cemetery was of considerable research interest. Recent work in the Shendi Reach has greatly increased our understanding of cultural transitions at the end of the Meroitic period (third-fourth centuries AD). However, Gabati has proved very interesting in having burials of the later Post-Meroitic and early medieval period (fifth-seventh centuries ap), through the period which saw the introduction of Christianity to the region. Previously very little was known of this period in the central Sudan except from excavations of the earliest levels black stones. The majority of the tombs were con- structed with large trapezoidal shafts, with a steeply sloping entrance ‘ramp’ with wide ledges cut along the sides. The oval or semi-circular grave chambers were accessed through narrow entrances cut in the end wall of the shaft. Similar grave forms have been found at el-Hobagi, but have not yet been found elsewhere. In contrast to the earlier Meroitic burials, in which graves were frequently reopened and reused, the Post- Meroitic tombs only held a single burial. This appears to be a significant and widespread change in practice at the end of the Meroitic period. Most of the grave om were oriented along an approximately east-west axis, with the bodies in the grave chambers laid in a con- tracted position, oriented north-south, as was the en with the earlier Meroitic burials on the site. The bodies were usually laid on their right sides with the head to the south, facing east, apparently a relatively standard arrangement during this period (fig. 144). The range of artefacts found with the burials was quite extensive (cats 175-8, 314-16), although there is no particular reason to believe that the people were"

This type of cryptography is often used in texts from medieval Nubia. The bowl comes from Room 21 in the North-western Annexe. This space was used as a midden during the Terminal Christian Period. The bowl belongs to a table set of Lazaros, an abbot of the Monastery of the Holy Trinity. Fragments of sixteen other pieces were found in the area of the monastery, including a large bowl, six smaller footed bowls or deep plates, three saucers, five cups of different forms and one storage jar. On some vessels the text refers to Lazaros along with his title of archimandrites (abbot) and contains the monastery denomination, the Holy Trinity, and his other title arch(i)styl(ites). The meaning of the latter is a matter of debate, but most probably it is the title of the person in the monastery who takes care of the spiritual life of monks (cf. Lajtar and Pluskota 2001, 347-9).

SDRS 21/03 Medieval, av 786 H 378 mm, W 235 mm, Th 48 mm SNM 31225 This roughly rectangular, blue-grey marble funerary stela, inscribed in Greek, was found inserted, the script upside down, in the brick pavement of Room 24 of the Upper Church. The text, but for some minor surface damage. is entirely preserved. Faint guidelines indicat- ing both the bottom and top of the letters are visible in lines 14 and 7 of the inscription. The hand may be described as round epi- graphic majuscles.! The stonemason used nomina sacra in lines 2 and 7. He abbreviates words through shifting the last written letter as in line 5, or by crossing the last written letter by an oblique stroke. Numerals are marked by a horizontal dash above, and f in line 5 also has points on both of its sides. The initial iota in the names Toadz and TaxwB has a trema. Letter heights range between 11 and 25 mm. The text reads: ‘Through the inclination and order of the living God, Markos, a Hegemon, fell asleep in the month of Phamenoth [day] 2nd, in the 9th indiction, in the year from Diocletian 502. God of spirits and of all flesh, rest his soul in the bosom of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob, in a shining place, ina place of refreshment. from which pain and grief and lamentation have fled away.’ The formula vetoe zai xeZeboer, found in the first three lines, is rare. It is found in the epitaph of Petros, Eparch of Nobadia (died ap 798), recovered at Old Dongola (cat. 186).? It also occurs in a fragmentarily preserved epitaph from Khor Dam Et-Tor near Bageri (Lajtar 2003, 73). The office of Hegemon is attested here for the second time so far in Christian Nubia. The other attestation is yielded by an epitaph, now in the Sudan National Museum, commemorating a Hege- mon with the name Theodorou (Theodoros). The Theodorou epitaph may be dated on palaeographic grounds to the eighth-tenth centuries. According to the Museum register, it came to light in Tangasi. There are two villages of this name between the Third and Fourth Cataracts: one on the right bank immediately south-east of Banganarti,* and the other on the left bank several kilometres west of Merowe. The discovery of the epitaph of the Hegemon Markos at Banganarti argues strongly for the former of these two villages as the provenance of the epitaph of the Hege- mon Theodorou. It can be hypothesized that both Hegemones were originally buried not far from each other, in the cemetery surrounding the ‘Lower Church’ at Banganarti. The exact meaning of the term Hegemon rel- ative to Christian Nubia remains unknown.* Since in the Eastern Roman Empire of the fifth-sixth centuries, the word Hegemon was a quasi-technical term for the governor of a province (Lat. praefectus, praeses), we may SUP- pose that the same or similar meaning may also be applied to it in Nubia. The Hegemones Markos and Theodorou living in the eighth- tenth centuries may have been governors of some administrative units within the King- dom of Makuria. Indiction and the Era of Diocletian are the standard systems used to indicate a year in early epitaphs from Nubia until the first half of the tenth century. Both indications agree with each other here, which is not always the case in Nubian inscriptions. The present epi- taph is the second oldest dated funerary inscription from the Dongola area, the oldest being the epitaph of a woman, Kel, discovered at Old Dongola and dated to ap 785."" The prayer for the dead contained in lines 7-16, is clearly modelled on the prayer a the Euchologion Mega-type characteristic of Nubian funerary inscriptions. It preserves from this prayer the initial invocation to God and a list of places of eternal rest for the deceased S soul. The prayer from Markos’s epitaph seems to have no exact parallel in Nubian epitaphs written in Greek, but more or less oad prayers do occur; the differences consist in : e kind of invocation and the choice of names al the places of rest. The epitaph of arene inating from Merowe is one such example."

L460 mm, W 360 mm SNM 31251 This roughly rectangular marble funerary stela belongs to an Alwan king named David. It is one of the few royal tombstones known and the only one of a king of Alwa. It is inscribed with twenty lines of Greek, below which three crosses are incised. The first three lines of the text are slightly larger in size than the follow- ing registers. It may have been set into the floor of a church in a fashion similar to the stela of Mariankouda (cat. 318). This may account for the illegible, worn text in the centre of the stone. The edges are also worn. The text con- tains a Nubian version of a common Byzantine prayer for the dead known as the Ebyohoyiov Heya. The humble nature of this stone may be contrasted with the more opulent, finer stela of Mariankouda. This may be a reflection of King David's personal piety or an indication of the type of raw materials and the level of skilled artisans available in Makuria as opposed to Alwa. The inscription reads as follows: ‘O God of the spirits and all flesh, Thou who hast rendered death ineffectual and has trodden down Hades, and hast given life to the world, rest the soul of [Thy] servant David, the King, in the bosom of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob, in a place of light, in a place of verdure, in a place of refreshment, whence grief and pain and mourning hath fled.

All three alternatives are depicted in the wall paintings discovered at Faras (Michatowski 1974, nos 19, 30, 35, 39). The numerous crosses, par- ticularly of iron, discovered at Soba indicate the widespread nature of Christianity among the population and might indicate preferen- tial usage of this metal.

The edges are rounded and the external face of the ring is slightly convex. This par- ticular style of loose is depicted in the Kushite reliefs at Musawwarat es-Sufra in association with archery equipment and is usually dated between 120 sc and ap 180 (Hayes 1973). Its appearance in a medieval context at Soba. along with other thumb- rings, suggests either reuse or continued production at a later date. The presence of Nubian archers is documented at Old Don- gola in the seventh century ab, where they fought against Arab invaders (Al-Baladhuri and Ibn al-Furat in Vantini 1975, 80-81, 528); however, it is unknown whether archers were primarily engaged in warfare or hunting.

This influenced cultural development as Arabic-speaking nomads entered the country from the seventh century ap onwards via Sinai, the Eastern Desert and the Red Sea. Sudan with its vast area, varied geo- graphical zones and peoples presents a unique pattern of Islamic archaeology in Africa (fig. 172). By the time the process of Islamization was well underway, regional resistance stemming from popular beliefs was strong and had to be overcome. Islamization was carried out to some extent by Muslims who immigrated to Sudan during the earliest Islamic period; however, the majority of this process was accomplished by indigenous individuals and/or groups who had previously converted to Islam, probably through the mediation of the aforementioned immi- grants.! The country as we know it was never part of an Islamic Caliphate except for a narrow strip of the Nile stretching downstream from the Third Cataract towards Egypt and the port of Suakin on the Red Sea coast. Both were part of the Ottoman Empire, so one would not expect Islam's cultural manifestations in Sudan to have been modelled after those of Egypt, Iraq or Iran. The rise of the al-'Umari state in the Eastern Desert, the Tunjur and the Keira Sultanates in the west, and the Funj Kingdom in central Sudan was only the culmination of a slow process of Arab migration. Three distinct phases in this lengthy and complex process can be recognized: Phase I — Ap 640-1300 (An 20-680) Phase II — av 1300-1500 (an 680-920) Phase III — av 1500-1800 (an 920-1480) Puase J Islamization began gradually in av 641 through contact with the first Muslims in Egypt, who signed a treaty with the kingdom of Makuria. This treaty, known as the Baqt, was primarily commercial but allowed for the slow infiltration of the nomadic tribes of Arabia into Sudan. Evidence for Islamization includes a mosque which is mentioned in the Baqt Treaty. A mosque is later referred to by al-Aswani in the late --- Page 240 --- SUDAN: ANCIENT TREASURES Tafa Qetassi_ |S An EGYPT Kalabsha } ‘SAUDI Qasr brim 4oELDerr pat ARABIA a f Aidhab @ N WADA S ""7"", Deraheib om Kulubnarti ing , ‘ie "" Thiae EASTERN \ “Seale a Hannek DESERT % fie Mia | Suakine. y El-Khandaq Badign. — Old Dongola Khor Nubt > SUDAN ij , cies ‘i CHAD P| Cran Uri : a Ain Farah e° Kobbe + 6 x Kabkabiyae ° ° f El-Fasher 0 e€l-Obeid ' 4 | Mey 7 | 7 , | goN Te Sein ee | J / Teed | CENTRAL —_— AFRICAN “tea, \ REBUBLIC ‘ ? in j , Mees a Se, ‘. 4 \ oS eel ~ 7 ‘ su Se 5"

The text relates that Mohamed ibn Mahmoud ibn Ahmed ibn al- Walid died on a Tuesday during the month of Sha’ban in 405 au (av 1015). The beginning of the inscription is missing, but likely began with ‘In the Name of God, the Merciful and the Com- passionate’.

And there is none like unto Him, Islamization was a gradual process in the Sudan and the presence of this early Arabic tombstone attests to the spread of 216 Muslims into the region.

While excavating test trenches in 1996 for a new architectural plan in the northern Courtyard 224 of the Great Enclosure at Musawwarat es-Sufra many sherds of Meroitic fine wares, both painted and/or stamped, were found. Although a few sam- ples of Meroitic fine wares had come to light during the 1960s when B, Hintze excavated in this location, this find was unexpected. Subsequently, in 1997, a 5 x 5-m trench was opened and approximately 22,500 sherds were excavated, Among the masses of house- hold wares mixed with ashes, almost 15 per cent consisted of beautiful pottery — an extremely high percentage. All of these sherds originate from a pottery workshop that flour- ished between the first century ue and the first century Ab, Similar pottery of this quality has been found, but only in a royal context (i.e., in pyramids or the palaces of the Royal City of Meroe). That these high-quality vessels were produced at Musawwarat es-Sulra indicates that the royal court visited from time to time. Because no traces of a kiln were found, it soon became clear that this pottery was pro- duced in an open bonfire. Traces of the fire are still visible on the inside walls of the north-eastern corner of courtyard 224. Asa result of the poor firing process, many vessels collapsed during firing. These fine wares were made of local clay, with some of the vessels made of kaolin clay. Primarily three colours were used (purple, black and red). Among the refuse were min- erals, but also some of the potters’ tools: hard-fired stamps for impressing designs on wet clay (cat. 225) and a slow potter's wheel (cat. 224). This is the first time that ancient potters’ tools were identified in the Sudan. Motifs, both painted and stamped, are typi- cally Meroitic: some are religious (Hathor, sa-knot) and royal (uraei: cat. 227), while others show plants (vine leaves: cat. 229) or common designs (guilloche, stars: cat. 228). Although similar pottery has been found in the Royal City of Meroe and at Hamadab. there is no exact parallel to that found at Musawwarat, which suggests that the potters at Musawwarat had their own ‘hand-writing’ and artistic traditions.

It represents the Holy Lamb, which stands in front of a chalice with the eucharis- tic bread. Identification of the animal, which resembles an antelope, is stressed by the inscription in Greek (mirror image) above the spine of the lamb: O AMNOZ TOY OY, ‘The Lamb of God’. The lamb’s head is embellished with the cross. The cross with pendants between its arms appears also on the eucharis- tic bread. The scene is surrounded by two con- centric circles and by a circle of satellite dots which allows us to date the stamp to the Clas- sic Christian period (Adams 1986, 222). The Stamp was found among the rubble of Room 2 of the service area of the Monastery of the Holy Trinity (Zurawski 1994b, 340, fig. 15). The most probable use of the stamp was to decorate pottery. In the collection of Nubian pottery in the National Museum in Warsaw there are two examples of centrepieces from small bowls with almost identical scenes impressed (238168 MN; 238169 MN). The stamp, however, could also have been used to decorate eucharistic loaves before baking (cf. Galey 1980, fig. 177) KP"

In Old Dongola, at Kom R1, the thickest rubble of such layers reached 4.6 m (Pluskota 2001, 360). The high percentage of pot- sherds in the debris indicates that either ‘Nubian potters were not careful enough’ (Adams 1986, I, 32) or that the speed of mass production resulted in numerous breakages. Some of the vessels were smashed during the removal from the kilns, but most of them broke in the kilns during firing or the subsequent stage of cooling. KP"

In the older archaeological literature they were called ‘wine jars’, but a more differentiated function for transport and storage is probable. Many were exported to Nubia filled with miscella- neous commodities, and during the Terminal A-Group phase much of this trade was concentrated in the southern parts of Lower Nubia. Potmarks, probably related to exchange and ownership, were common. These precious jars had a long life. They were often reused and mended, having repair holes along old cracks. A few whole specimens of smaller size were even placed as offerings in C-Group burials 1,000 years later. H-AN Reinold 2000a, 87, 138; 2003g; Wildung 1997, 45, no. 38"

The exterior is black-burnished, while the interior has been roughly smoothed. The whole of the exterior surface of the bow! is covered in quasi-geometric impressed dec- oration, possibly made with a fishbone. The sides gently curve inwards while the base has been pushed in, giving it an omphalos shape. Running around the rim immediately below it is a register of holes, pierced before firing from the exterior towards the interior. Traces of red ochre suggest that a coloured red strip of leather (?) was once threaded through the holes. Alternatively, because traces of colour were not found in the holes, the effect of a strip may have been simply painted on. It has been suggested that the holes were for hang- ing the bowl, but the traces of colour and the close spacing of the holes suggest that they were more likely to have been for additional decoration in the form of a trim. Two sets of holes further down the body were possibly intended as ‘suspension holes’, although their location does not seem suitable for this pur- pose. Another almost identical but smaller bowl was found in the same grave. IWS Welsby Sjéstrém 2001a, 302, fig. 5.33"

A decorative band of finely incised cross-hatching runs around the rim on the exterior. The highly polished surface of the vessel was created by burnishing the sur- face with a pebble; the red colour results from the application of red ochre. Both were done before firing in an oxidizing (oxygen-rich) atmosphere. The black top was created by upending the vessel into a reducing atmos- . phere during firing (Gratien 1978, 220-28). The Kerma Ancien period does not display a wide variety of vessel forms. Those shapes that are found have av: «i‘tinity with C-Group pottery from Lower Nubia, and it has been suggested that the two pottery traditions may have developed from a common origin (Bonnet 1990a, 126-31; Gratien 1978, 307-13).

The largest register comprises ankh signs in diamonds and triangles of a lattice motif. It is bordered by a chain of trefoil motifs. The cleanness and the regularity of the lines, as well as the frieze of large beads running along the rim, ascribe this vessel to the ‘severe pharaonic style’ (T6rdk 1987b, 199-202). The Meroitic cemetery at Kerma is much larger than G.A. Reisner’s excavation origi- nally led one to suspect: it developed from the centre of the ancient Nubian city to the dis- trict of Dokki Gel, where the ruins of the New Kingdom city and the subsequent Kushite period are found (see p. 109 ff.). The cultiva- tion of certain areas caused disturbances in loci that destroyed or disturbed numerous burials; therefore it is not rare for ceramics to appear on the surface. NF Bonnet 1988, 19"

Imported wares are rare at this time at Soba, Many characteristic styles are present, with painted designs applied on the exterior and occasion- ally the interior overtop of brown, red or --- Page 272 --- -ooed surfaces. Usually the interior and =» ior are slipped with the same colour; howeve:, when differing colours are used sometimes the darker slip is extended over the rim to form a band around the rim on the interior or exterior. Bowls, basins, jars, cups, chalices (cats 193, 198) and lids are the pri- mary vessel forms used. The painted decora- tion appears to be strongly influenced by Christian decorative artistic traditions as seen in contemporary Nubian wall paintings. A wide range of distinctive designs are pre- sent, with the decoration commonly situated within horizontal or vertical registers. Deco- rative motifs include human faces, roundels, animals such as lions, birds, frogs and gazelle, backgrounds filled with dots, ovals or crosses, repeating friezes and geometric patterns. Crosses are among the most common motifs. Bosses may also be painted and modelled in the shape of animal heads. Some of these motifs are quite distinct and might suggest the hand of one artist, or of a school or group following a set pattern.

It is much rarer than Soba Ware, sug- gesting that it might have been imported to the Soba region. Analogous examples have been discovered at Old Dongola and Gabati (cat. 258), and there may have been a kiln producing this ware in the vicinity of Old Dongola. The exterior surface of these vessels is usually covered with orange or red slip on to which the design is applied in black paint.

Its general shape is lanceolate; the thick base was shaped by the removal of a few large flakes whereas the tip was carefully trimmed by alternating sec- ondary retouch. It is made from locally avail- able Nubian sandstone. This object was found on a land surface dating to the late Middle Pleistocene, amongst a small scatter of arte- facts containing one other handaxe and numerous production flakes from a third. The latter handaxe itself was not present. The small Acheulian cluster overlies a wider distribution of Early/Middle Palaeolithic, Sangoan artefacts. The latter are always made out of quartz and are radically different in terms of typology. This evidence indicates that these are the remains of two separate occupation events by humans with very dif- ferent behaviour patterns, who were roaming in the same landscape. Evidence of other Early/Middle Palaeolithic and Late Acheulian occupations were found below the present one, suggesting that the Early to Middle Palacolithic transition was a rapid phenomenon caused by population replacement, The handaxe is covered with a calcitic crust as a result of pedogenetic processes occurring in the early Late Pleistocene.

The outline of the object is oval and it presents a well-developed longitudinal symmetry. The edges are characteristically shaped as a result of the particular produc- tion technique: using a hard hammer for direct percussion. This core-axe was made from a thick quartz flake. On the upper part, a large negative of an ‘adze-blow’ is visible. This was intended to sharpen the edge for use. Pebbles of fine quartz are locally avail- able in ancient Nile terraces. This particular object was probably prepared at the spot where the quartz was exploited, and brought to Site 8-B-11 in a more or less prepared state. At this site it received its final preparation: its insertion into a haft. Core-axes are characteristic tools for an Early/Middle Palaeolithic tool industry called SUDAN: ANCIENT TREASURES the Sangoan. Until recently, the latter was believed to be a sub-Saharan phenomenon. The discovery of three well-defined Sangoan levels at Sai provides the first firm evidence for a much larger distribution of the Sangoan throughout Africa. PyP Van Peer et al. 2003"

A natural slab was shaped into a roughly rectangular form by removing large flakes from the sides. Then one face of the slab was made flat by pecking it with a stone hammer, except for two areas where the natural surface of the slab was preserved. A large depression was cut out, surrounded by a series of small holes that seem to have origi- nated as a result of a rotating movement. It may have served as a grinding stone or mortar. After a fracture along the edge. in the area of the depression. the object was reshaped by means of obverse flakes. Two of these were recovered nearby and were refitted at the right edge of the object. Its present shape, therefore, is the result of a reworking of the grinding stone, perhaps an oppor- tunistic adaptation to a new function. This is one of the earliest examples in the world of an intensively shaped grinding stone. In fact. such objects are extremely rare throughout the Palaeolithic period. It testifies to complex behaviour in the Early/Middle Palaeolithic. PvP Van Peer et al. 2003 27 --- Page 291 --- SUDAN: ANCIENT TREASURES"

Around the face, which is sculpted in the round, a tripartite wig falls on the shoul- ders and back. On the chest some beads represent the ousekh-collar. A hole through the head shows that the object was intended to be hung around the neck. This hybrid object is a good illustration of an important Egyptian idea regarding the heart. It was not only the main organ in the body - the place where all the vital functions converged in life as well as in the afterlife, mainly at the crucial moment of the Judgement — but it was also thought to be a real being, here indicated by its personification through a human head. The pendant shown here is uninscribed and undecorated. Sometimes similar items give the name of the deceased or representations of the benou-bird, the purple heron or phoenix, thought to be the soul of the sun god Ra.

It looks like a a twisted and knotted piece of cloth, and so has been named ‘Isis knot’ by Egyptologists. It has been modelled in dark red faience and the upper ties painted in black. The verso is flat. The front side bears the name of the deceased, inscribed between two vertical lines, the whole painted in black. He is the ‘Osiris’ Userhat. One of the most frequently found in a funerary context, either in pictorial form as represented in the vignettes of the Book of the Dead, or as a real prophylactic ornament, this amulet symbolized protection by the blood of the goddess Isis. It was frequently associated with another amulet, the djed-pillar, symbol of the Ruler of the Realm of the Dead, Osiris. A special spell of the Book of the Dead is dedicated to the tyet-amulet, pre- scribing that it must be made of red jasper, hung on a cord made of sycamore fibre and placed around the neck of the deceased on his burial day. By this means, the deceased could get the magic power of Isis and have 284 SUDAN: ANCIENT TREASURES his body protected in the Underworld. Another proof that the present object was intended to be used in a funerary context is the inscription which specifies that its owner has become ‘an Osiris’. This means he is now united with this god in the ‘Field of Offerings’, having passed the test of the weighing of his heart against the feather of truth (ma‘at), in the presence of the divine tribunal presided over by Osiris.

It was believed that because of his strange and terrifying appearance Bes could ward off evil and catastrophe. Thus he was the special pro- tector of expectant mothers. As a domestic deity, his image was commonly used to deco- rate pieces of furniture or toilet objects. His image was also worn as an amulet around the neck or tattooed on the body.

Each eye consists of a shape in faience, lengthened by a cosmetic line towards the temple. The form is hollow and contains the remains of a paste forming the cornea in which the pupil, a hard black stone, polished and brilliant, was inserted.

The vases have the usual shape of canopic jars, with a high rounded shoulder closing on a narrow collar and with a narrow flat base; the fabric is fine, the colour of chamois (yel- lowish-brown), and it is covered with a bright burnished red slip. The rather conical lid has a concave base to match the profile of the vase. It is provided with a small extension and is surmounted with a human head moulded in the round; the features, of which the eyes, nose and mouth are indicated by light relief work, are framed by a wide wig. This shape imitates that of the human-headed canopic jars of the 18th Dynasty. These miniature vases had a magical role and did not contain any organic remains. Models of canopic jars such as these, with well-known context, are not so common in Egypt and Nubia during this period, and it is interestizg to note that, in Sai island, another complete group as well as four lids and elements of other groups were brought to light in that particular cemetery.

It was found ° with the beautiful shabti of ‘Count’ Neby for whom it was intended. The sandstone sar- cophagus consists of a coffer with an anthro- pomorphic lid and imitates the type of coffin in use in the 18th Dynasty. The lid, whose decoration is almost completely erased, was originally painted in black. It contained four white columns — a vertical median band and three horizontal columns - reserved for a text which had not been inscribed. The columns continue on the coffer which is also black, and on the bottom of the lid. On the lid the human head wears a wide, originally black tripartite wig, which leaves the ears free. The features of the face, the eyes, nose and mouth, are sculpted in relief: one of the pupils retains its black colour. This evokes in minia- ture the bitumen-coated sarcophagi with inscribed bands on a black ground. The four holes for mortises correspond to each other, on opposite sides, on the box and on the lid. Remains of a red colour are preserved inside the coffer which must have been repaired in the ancient past, because on the base three wide grooves have been hollowed out to receive the bonding medium.

Carved in calcite (alabaster), they represent two of the sons of Horus — the human-headed Imsety, who guarded the liver, and the baboon-headed Hapy, who protected the lungs. Stylistically, the lids are indistin- guishable from Egyptian examples, and they were almost certainly made by experienced Egyptian craftsmen. Differences in scale and technique suggest that two different sculptors may have produced them, a circumstance seen in other sets of visceral containers from Egypt. A set of four jars, made of stone, pottery or wood, formed an important element of the traditional Egyptian elite burial. These vessels, known to Egyptologists as canopic jars, were the receptacles for the viscera that were removed from the corpse during mummifi- cation. Liver, lungs, stomach and intestines were each placed in a separate jar, the lid of which was carved to represent the head of a deity. These gods, the Sons of Horus, were responsible for the protection of the various body parts. The jars were introduced in the Old Kingdom around 2500 sc. With changes in mummification procedures, in about 1100 ac, the preserved viscera began to be replaced inside the body, but empty or dummy canopic jars continued to be deposited in the tomb, out of respect for tradition (cf. cat. 287). Beginning with Piankhi (Piye), the Kushite kings gradually adopted more and more features of Egyptian funerary practice. They were buried beneath pyramids, and their bodies were mummified and enclosed in anthropoid coffins, Canopic jars, shabti figures and amulets of Egyptian type were placed in their tombs, The two missing lids and the jars to which they belonged had been plundered from Shabaqo's tomb; it is likely, however, that they were either solid ‘dummies’ or contained only --- Page 296 --- » oc! scentary cavity, since it was not until the «oign of Tahargo that canopic jars began once raore to fulfil their practical purpose of holding the viscera.

According to Egyptian custom these were small figures that took the form of the mummy of the deceased (cf. cats 290-91) and were thought to be his magical alter egos. Just as, in life, the king could call upon his subjects to perform such hard labour as dredging canals and hauling sand, it was also feared that in the afterlife even the king might be called to work by the great god. Shabtis, it was believed, made it possible to avoid this work. Tahargo’s shabtis are individually inscribed with a standard text that explains their purpose: If anyone summons King Tahargo to his work [in the City of the Dead?] indeed, there is a good reason why he should not do it! [?] for you, Shabti, shall say: Anyone may summon at any time and I shall act according to orders, whether it be planting fields, irrigating river banks, or even if it be conveying the sands of the west bank to the east and vice versa. If anyone orders forth King Tahargo, the justified, to do any of the work which is customarily done in the City of the Dead, then verily I shall do it, and I shall speak up in the City of the Dead, saying: I am hel’ Taharqo's shabtis range in height from 180 to 600 mm and are carved of speckled gran- ite, green ankerite, or white calcite. They were placed standing around the walls of the tomb's chambers and corridors, sometimes two and three rows deep. They wear either the khat headdress or the nemes royal crown (with one uraeus rather than two), and they hold the royal crook and flail, or hoes and baskets (slung over the shoulders), or in some cases djed amulets symbolizing eternity. Certain repetitive details and facial features reveal the hands of different sculptors, The 293 fact that calcite is only found in Egypt sug- gests that some or all of the shabtis were carved there and shipped south in prepara- tion for the king's burial.

The dimensions of the chapels were often so small that it would have been impossible to carry out the ceremonies within. On each side of the door, the door jambs that supported the entab- lature could be decorated with deities in the act of adoration (raised arms in front of the face) or pouring water for the funerary libation, as here on the superbly preserved northern jamb of the chapel of Netemkhor, a man of note at Sedeinga in the second century AD. Anubis, with a jackal’s head, wearing a long fringed skirt tied with a sash, wears rich jewellery on his arms, wrists and ankles; in honour of the dead person, he pours water from a situla (a breast-shaped vessel frequently used in the cult of Isis). On the other door jamb, now lost, a female deity would have faced him in the same attitude as can be seen on the offering table from the same chapel (cat. 303).

The representation on this table, in the name of Netemkhor (cf. cat. 304), identifies the ceremony: in the centre is Isis holding a small round vase, while facing her is Anubis with a jackal head, pouring for the dead person the libation over loaves of bread and trussed ducks piled up over an altar-chapel.

Medieval graves were orientated east-west, with the head usually to the west. The grave monu- ments were built of irregularly-shaped stones infilled with small pebbles and soil, forming a ‘box’ over the actual burial. Grave 92, how- ever, did not have an associated superstruc- ture. If such a monument had been provided it must have been demolished during the later use of the cemetery. This rectangular grave measured 1.4 x 0.35 m and was 0.98 m deep. A series of flat stones spanned the ledges on either side of the body so that it was protected from the grave infill. This is a common occur- rence in burials of this period. Usually the body was laid on its back in an extended posi- tion, but this skeleton was either too large for the grave or had been deliberately placed in a flexed position. The body was wrapped in a coarsely woven brown shroud which was held in place by a cord around the head, neck, waist, knees and feet.

Three small crosses are incised above the inscription and one incised cross is preserved below the text. Prior to carv- ing the inscription, several register lines were lightly engraved and remain visible, The text contains twenty-eight lines of incised Greek. It bears a late ninth-century date, the name of the Makurian king, Georgios, and mentions the name of Mariankouda and his administra- tive title, Tetrarchos — the only reference to this office discovered thus far. Mariankouda was probably buried in a crypt close to the inscrip- tion, The Mariankouda stela is similar to the circular inscription of King Georgios discov- ered in Egypt in the Wadi Natrun (Griffith 1928, 124), Another similar stela was discov- ered in the Cathedral of the Brick Pillars at Old Dongola embedded in the floor in a compara- ble manner (Gartkiewicz 1990, 302, pl. 177a), and two fragments from a different round stela were recently found in excava- tions at Kom H, Old Dongola (Lajtar 2003, pers. comm.). This extremely fine stela, of a high-ranking Makurian official, contrasts dramatically with the poor quality stela of the Alwan king David (cat. 197), both in the sophistication of the Greek text and quality of material utilized. The inscription reads as follows: ‘O patient, compassionate, very merciful, true God, You, at the beginning, have created man according to Your likeness and resemblance and then, when he, through the trick of the snake, has fallen out from the paradise of joy and, as a consequence of his disobedience, was subjected to death and became different from You, the one that you have held in esteem, [and You], in Your unspeakable glory, did not overlook [his] troublesome life and wearisome living but in Your mercy have shown compassion on him and were willing to look for and to save the sheep that was led astray and have sent Your only-begotten son that having been born of woman was subjected to law in order that he would redeem those who were subjected to law, for which reason he directly has come (and), after receiving a human body and becoming man and through ascending onto the wood [= cross] has saved all those who were subjected to death, [and] on the account of what God said to Adam ‘you are earth and into earth you will turn again’, through the aw inclination and will of God the me blessed Mariankouda, son of T[.Jophena, Tetrarch of the land of Makouria, has fallen asleep in the month of Payni [day] 11th, in the year from thes Martyrs 603, from his birth until his destiny he lived 72 years receiving all hi authority from the order of our blessed orthodox King Georgios.

Previously known as the Hamdab Dam, it has recently been renamed ‘Merowe’ after a small island, the tinea part of which will be cut through by the structure of the dam itself. Most of the local inhabitants pronounce the name of this island Mirowy. . For various reasons this project was not realized for sixty years. Ever since it came to power in 1989 the present government has considered the dam a project of top Priority because it will create enough hydroelectric power (1250 mg/w) to advelap many sectors of the national economy. After many studies made by expert aie national institutions and companies, the government of the Sudan decided to build a single dam, crossing the island of Merowe, located about 26 km upstream from the pyramids of Nuri. The completion of the project is scheduled for August 2008. The highest water level (reached during flood season) will be about 300 m above sea level. This will result in the inundation of a strip of land, about 170 km upstream of the dam. A lake approximately 4 km wide will be formed immediately behind the dam. This will necessitate the relocation of more than 48,000 people from their homes, The aim of the Merowe Dam Archaeological Salvage Project (MDASP) is to rescue archaeological sites endangered by the construction of this dam (figs 194—5).! A considerable number of archaeological sites will be affected to varying degrees: * Sites which will either be destroyed by the engineering activities at the dam site or covered by the waters of the lake upstream. This will include a strip of land of about 170 km on both banks of the Nile, together with many islands. Sites which will be destroyed by the building of houses and digging of irrigation canals in the resettlement areas. Sites which will be affected by the construction of power transmission lines. Although the monumental sites of the Napatan Region will not be directly affected by these activities, the National Corporation for Antiquities and Museums (NCAM) is concerned about the expected environmental changes. These sites include the famous Pharaonic and Kushite towns and cemeteries at Jebel Barkal, Nuri, Sanam, el-Kurru, Hillat el-Arab, the Post-Meroitic tumuli of ez-Zuma and Tangqasi, the Christian monastery of el-Ghazali, and the later strongholds at Merowe East, Kagabi, el-Datti, and possibly other sites located further downstream. --- Page 310 ---"

On top of its natural gloss, resulting from ae transportation in the Nile river bed, one of its faces shows a very intensive polish. This polish, with parallel striations, is undoubtedly the result of the pebble’s use by humans. Chert pebbles showing an association of clearly contrasting colours, such as red and black in this case, are extremely rare in the natural gravel deposits which were exposed at the site during the early Middle Palaeolithic occupation. Nevertheless they occur quite frequently in Level 6 and it is, therefore, likely that they were deliberately selected from the wider environment. As some of them show adhering particles of ochre, their use seems to be related to pigment processing. This, in turn, suggests that pigment processing may have had ritual connotations. PvP Van Peer et al, 2003 --- Page 32 --- SUDAN: ANCIENT TREASURES 29 TriE SAGGAI REGION ISABELLA CANEVA he site of Saggai was excavated between 1979 and 1981, and again in 1990.! One of the prehistoric settlements which line the right bank of the Nile, about 40 km north of Khartoum, it was the first such site to be excavated after A.J. Arkell’s archaeological discoveries in the area. It revealed a cul- ture similar to that of the Khartoum Hospital site? and was carbon-14 dated to c. 5700 sc. The site consisted of an extensive dwelling area, with abundant settlement remains such as artefacts and food residues, scattered in a 600 mm-thick archaeo- logical deposit. Human burials were found in all test pits, as in all other such sites, which suggests that burials in these cultures were commonly associated with the dwellings. Chronologically on the borderline between the Palaeolithic and Neolithic, this culture is characterized by peculiar technological achievements, which include its pottery production and a complex settle- ment and territorial occupation. The earliest pottery is, quite unexpectedly, of very high technical quality (thin-walled, well fired) and aesthetic appearance (intensively and finely decorated with impressed motifs), The decoration covers the whole surface, from the rim to the round bottom, on most of the pots. The motifs, which vary according to the technique and tool used, are either widely spaced or packed, or arranged in bands, with different designs sometimes alternated. Implements include a wide range of bone artefacts (harpoons, perforators and handles), grind- ing stones and a large number of geometric microliths to be hafted into composite tools. Hunting and fishing were the main strategies for food procurement, as is attested by the tools and bone waste. Human bone pathology and chemistry suggest that the Saggai people consumed fish, molluscs and meat. Sedentariness and pottery-making in non-food pro- ducing societies are among the most notable peculiari- ties of African prehistory. The combined presence at Saggai of pottery and grinding equipment, which are quite common throughout the Sahara and Sudan well before the adoption of any form of food production, should not be taken as an argument for the presence of agriculture. The absence of botanical evidence and low ecological probability speak against it. The earliest post- Palaeolithic hunter-gatherers were defined in Sudan as Mesolithic because of their sedentary sites which lay close to the river, and because of their heavy depen- dence on riverine resources, as shown by food residues. These cultures, dated in this area to between c. 6000 and 4100 sc, were basically settled along the Nile but used the hinterland as a complementary hunting terri- tory as well as a supply area for raw material for their grinding equipment. Besides this rather ordinary site catchment, however, these groups were recently dis- covered to have established an exceptionally complex settlement pattern in the area. This system comprised functionally specialized settlements distributed over a vast territory, which extended from the Nile to at least"

This example has a long butt. Harpoons, with up to four barbs on one side only, have been found at other Mesolithic sites, such as Khartoum Hospital (Arkell 1949a, 75).

Relatively thick, one of their facets still presents the sur- face of the original canine, which is of an impressive size, and must have belonged to a very large hippopotamus. The bracelets have been made from the tooth cut longitudinally rather than being cut as a cross section. They were then perforated and partially polished. This type of bracelet is found both in adult and infant graves. These thick examples were found by the wrists of the skeleton, but the finer pieces could also be worn at the biceps. Ivory bracelets are common in burials along the Nile Valley. Amongst others, they have been found in the Neolithic graves at Kadruk (Reinold 2000a. 79), in Neolithic or Predynasy tic burials in Upper Egypt (Brunton ane Caton-Thompson 1928), in A-Group con» texts (Nordstrém 1972, 127) and at Kermz (Bonnet 1990a, 180).

Incised grooves around the neck undoubtedly represent necklaces (one example also shows two small holes, by the location of the arms that were intended to hold in place a string of ostrich eggshell beads); those at the level of the pelvis seem to correspond to tattoos or to decorated clothes, Figurines of this form are the most fre- quent type found at el-Kadada, although they are not found elsewhere in Nubia.

Whilst always in a funerary environ- ment, they have been found in different contexts — in graves of children, women and men, some rich in grave goods, though occa- sionally they were the only such object in the grave. The only certainty is that the schemati- zation of the human body is not due to a lack of skill of the artist (one figurine is made in such a realistic fashion that it has formed the basis of an anatomic-physiological lecture). but to the desire to produce a symbolic repre- sentation of it.

It is only at Jebel Tageru 84/34 that several fragments have been found (Jesse 2003, 255). The unilaterally and bilaterally barbed harpoons were made out of the long bones of large mammals. The harpoons pre- sent a flat oval cross section and have three or four barbs, Harpoons were used for hunting aquatic game such as hippopotamus and crocodile (Kuper 1988, 136), and for fishing. They are widespread on sites of the early pottery horizon throughout the Sahara (see Sutton 1974), thus their rare occurrence in the Southern Libyan Desert is surprising. Harpoons found on sites of the Early Khar- toum Horizon in Sudan are usually unilater- ally barbed (e.g. Saggai: Zarattini 1983, 246; Khartoum Hospital: Arkell 1949a, 75: Atbara Region: Haaland 1995, 130).

The wide range of forms includes small lunates, triangular and tanged types as well as numerous transitional forms (Keding 1993, fig. 2). The sharp sides were the cutting edges of the arrowheads, while the retouched sides guaranteed firm hafting in wooden shafts. They are made of fine-grained stone, mainly chalcedony and jasper. These raw materials are found in the adjacent moun- tainous areas and thus indicate middle- distance transportation or trade with people from Jebel Tageru to the south, Jebel Rahib to the east, or the Ennedi Hills to the west. Transverse arrowheads were usually used for weapons, However, in the context of the cattle-keeping groups of the Leiterband Horizon, where remains of hunted animals are almost never found, they may also have been used to pierce the veins of the animals to extract blood, Today, the ‘bleeding’ of cattle is a widespread practice among cattle keepers in East Africa where blood is sometimes an important nutritional supplement (Dahl and Hjort 1976, 172 ff; Evans-Pritchard 1937,"

One axe has a sharpened and partly polished cutting edge, while the other is rounded for use as a hammer. They are made of a greenish, fine-grained, homoge- nous stone (trachyte). Chips on the edges and necks are the result of being used on hard material. Ground axes of the Darfur type are a spe- cial feature of Leiterband assemblages (Kuper 1981, fig. 4.3). They were probably primarily used for woodworking, but their function as prestige items cannot be excluded. Their dis- tribution is concentrated in the Wadi Howar region and the south-eastern Sahara (Keding 1997a, 192-5; Kuper 1981, 273). BK Keding 1996, figs 5.4, 5; 1997a, pls 74.1, 2 38"

The red-brown colour, thin walls, sand-tempered matrix, simple rounded rim and globular shape fit well into the usual spectrum of Leiterband pottery, Decoration sometimes covers the entire body of the vessel. The rim zone is decorated with a wavy band consisting of opposed rounded impres- sions that are typical of the Leiterband Hori- zon. Body and base are covered with narrow impressed Leiterband patterns, interrupted by two long polished triangular zones. Each tri- angle is embellished by a single rosette made of Leiterband ornaments. A similar rosette decorates the centre of the rounded base. The polished surface of the vessel, as well as the more varied and complex arrangement of the decoration, suggests that the pot had more than a purely utilitarian purpose. Like most of the well-preserved pottery fragments of the Leiterband Horizon, it was found in an eroded pit together with numerous cattle bones. This unusual association, found on some sites in the Wadi Howar region, may have had a ritual significance (Keding 1997a, 204-40). BK Keding 1989, 35; 1997a, pl. 70.2"

The very homogenous thin- walled ware is of high quality. It is character- ized by careful surface treatment, an almost exclusively inorganic temper consisting mainly of sand, and it was constructed using the coil technique. The round-bottomed egg- shape with no neck restriction and a non- modelled rim is a characteristic pot form of this period, As in this case, many Leiterband pots were decorated from rim to base. Typi- cal patterns are Leiterband ornaments, impressed in the rocker-stamp technique with a gap-toothed implement and arranged in narrow horizontal bands, While other patterns related to the Leiter- band complex have also been found in the Nile Valley, the distribution of the eponymous decoration of this cultural horizon is restricted to the Wadi Howar region and adjacent areas to the west as far as Mali (Commelin 1983, pl. LIV, 3-7; Keding 1997a, fig. 74). Detailed analysis of the pottery of the Leiterband Horizon suggests a common origin with the Khartoum Neolithic of the Nile Valley, fol- lowed by a more local development which seems to have become more and more orientated towards the western areas (Keding --- Page 62 --- a a 39,40 1998). The people who used the Leiterband pottery were the first cattle herders in this region. They lived in an area climatically favourable for an economy based on cattle, fish and wild grains, BK Keding 1989, 35; 1993, fig. 3.5; 1996, fig. 8.5; Kuper 1981, fig. 1; 1986, fig. 1; Richter 1989, fig. 6.2"

It was found upside down near a small group of burials. The pot has a curved profile and a pronounced neck. It is thin-walled, finely smoothed, tempered with sand and fibre, and was formed by pinching and drawing. Irregu- larities in the ochre-brown colour of the outer surface are the result of uncontrolled firing conditions, typical of open-field firing. The outer surface has mat impressions from base to belly, a typical feature of Handessi A pottery. The clearly structured decoration is restricted to the rim and the upper part of the vessel, and underlines the composite contours of the pot. The inner rim is decorated with a narrow band of oblique comb impressions running parallel to the rim. On the outer surface, triangles are outlined by comb impressions and filled with densely dotted zig-zags produced by the rocker- stamp technique. Two rows of opposing tri- angles, one on either side of a group of three parallel horizontal lines, give an impression of a large rhombus. Though following the general trend of this period towards geometric decorations on curved-profile vessels, supra-regional parallels to Handessi A pottery are found only in indi- vidual cases. They point to connections with western (Bailloud 1969) as well as northern areas (Jesse in press a). BK Keding 1998, pl. 6; Jesse and Keding 2002, fig. 9"

The simple rounded lip is decorated with dense oblique impressions. The upper part of the outer surface of the bowl is covered with 45 simple impressions forming several bands of herringbone pattern. The decoration was applied with a spatula. Two vessels, one inside the other, were placed on the pelvis of the deceased. Additional offerings including a shell, a small axe, stone artefacts, a lump of ochre; fish and burnt cattle remains were also placed in this adult male burial. The smaller of the two vessels, which is displayed here, has a brownish burnished surface and was tempered with sand. Both the pottery and the grave are very different from the usual finds in the Middle Wadi Howar, but show some similarities with A-Group and Pre-Kerma finds in the Nubian Nile Valley (Nordstrém 1972, 130). This clearly points to stronger relationships with cultures to the east than to the west of the Wadi Howar region.

The other is oval with rounded edges, again with convex faces. Both taper down towards the edges and are made of quartzite, The two faces of these palettes are polished and their extremities present slight traces of percussion, They were found in graves located near the Pre-Kerma settle- ment. The larger one was discovered in the 47 mostly destroyed tomb of an adult. The smaller palette has a much finer finish. It was located in a rich, partially destroyed burial of a woman. Placed near the hands of the body, it was accompanied by two small pebbles used as grinders, and covered some fragments of malachite, used as a pigment. Make-up tablets are known from Neolithic and protohistoric Nubian burials. Examples of metamorphic rock, dating to the fifth millennium nc, have been found at Kadruka, not far from Kerma (Reinold 2000a). The quartzite examples appear to be more recent and are found in the A-Group graves of Lower Nubia (Nordstrom 1972, 120). Occasionally Kerma Ancien graves contain palettes, but these become increasingly rare in this later period (Bonnet 1990a, 200). MH"

Finely polished, its shape is oval and slightly concave. This object, found in a female grave, was accompa- nied by rich grave goods: palette, grinders, ivory cup, combs, flints and copper-alloy objects. Its function is not clear. It may simply be a dish, intended for food, unless its use is related to that of a palette and therefore was used for grinding or pounding. Such objects have also been found in A-Group graves (Nordstrém 1972, 121). MH"

Its colour tends towards dark grey on its interior and around the rim, while it is beige on the rest of the exterior. These differences in colour are a result of the type of firing: the jar will have been placed upside down in an open-air fire. The decora- tion, restricted to the rim, is composed of parallel incisions, occasionally arranged in a chevron pattern. Of the 285 excavated pits in the Pre-Kerma settlement, only two contained jars. These will have been used for food stor- age, probably of cereals. The jar presented here was found upside down, with the open- ing to the bottom of the pit. This position indi- cates that it was probably not in use at the time the place was abandoned. This type of jar has parallels among the A-Group pottery assemblage (Nordstrém 1972, pl. 182).

It was placed in a leather bag that contained a small bowl. also of black clay, and a pair of sandals. Its shape recalls that of a seal, particularly since one of its surfaces is incised with a few curved lines filled with white paste, like the impres- sions that might decorate the body of a bowl. Another small baked clay object in the shape of a mushroom, found in the same sector — albeit on the surface — resembles seals discov- ered at Mahal Teglinos (Fattovich 1995). Without a doubt Kerma was very early on an essential transit point on the trade routes of SUDAN: ANCIENT TREASURES exotic products prized by Egypt.

This vessel is part of a small series from the last two great tumuli of the eastern necropolis (K IV and K III) exca- vated by G.A. Reisner. The latter considered these as imitations of basketry; he had observed the remains of a basket of this same shape in a more ancient tomb (Reisner 1923b, 318 [K XX]).

As light as they are fragile, they often show repair holes. They generally come from the backfill of tombs or were recovered on the surface; therefore, their use is not known with certainty. Their fasten- ing system is identical to keyhole-shaped ornaments typical of the C-Group, considered by Steindorff to be hair ornaments rather than earrings, simply based on the narrow- ness of the slit (Steindorf 1935, 63, fig. 14). These ornaments and other finery made of mother-of-pearl appear not to have been worn during the Kerma Classique period.

The pearl oysters from which these pieces were cut came in all like- lihood from the Red Sea. Like the mother-of- pearl ornaments above (cat. 60), these pierced shells are mostly found in tombs dated to the Kerma Ancien and Kerma Moyen periods.

These pieces were probably imported from Egypt where they are found in abun- dance (Davies 1982, 189-92; Freed 1982, 193-5). Although their use has yet to be determined with certitude — whether razor, tweezers, scissors, curling iron, scraper, or surgical clamp ~ they are generally consid- ered to be personal hygiene tools, often associated with other instruments of this category.
