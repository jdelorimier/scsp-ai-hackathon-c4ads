This little balance is made up of a stand
in the form of a palm column, a beam
terminating in papyrus umbels, and
two copper dishes. It was probably
used for weighing gold from the mines
of the eastern desert, which was des-
tined for Egypt via the fortresses on the
Second Cataract.

The brief inscriptions list the numbers
5, 6, and 7 next to the hieroglyphic
sign for “gold.” But the exact weight
of the stones cannot be aligned with
these numbers. Both the scale and the
weights indicate that only small quan-
tities of gold were being weighed,
before they were sent over the south-

Round buildings were characteristic of
the architecture of the capital city of
Kerma. In addition to the two deffufas,
the “skyline” was dominated by a
large, hemispherical structure that
probably served as a royal palace (cf.
fig. 19). It was surrounded by smaller
oval huts. This ensemble resembles
quite closely the archetypal image of
the central African settlement and, in
contrast to Egyptian architecture,
introduces completely new perspec-
tives.

This vessel with cover, painted black,
red, and yellow over a white back-
ground, could represent a model of
one of these round shelters. The cover
particularly supports this interpreta-
tion, since it imitates the thatched roof
construction used in such buildings.
The vessel is usually considered to be
an imitation of a woven basket, but
there are no parallels or other archaeo-
logical materials to support this inter-
pretation.

Like the Nubian/Sudanese Neolithic
and the A-Group Culture, the Kerma
Culture defined itself above all by its
ceramics. The technical standard of
manufacturing hard-fired, thin-walled
pottery is equaled by the formal deco-
ration of the vessels. Figural pottery
makes up a separate category, consist-
ing mostly of pitchers, their spouts
decorated with animal heads. This red-
polished, spherical pitcher, with a han-
dle in imitation of rope, has a spout
with the head of a horned animal. This
is probably a goat, to judge from the
form and remains of the broken horns.
A double band is incised around the
neck. On the back is a six-pointed
rosette, perhaps to be understood as
the rear quarters of the animal. The
modeled figure of a striding male has
been added in bold relief to the right
side. He wears a kilt (and a phallus
sheath?), and holds a long staff out in
front of him. He is a shepherd and
leads an animal behind him (difficult to
see because of the lacunae in the
restored vessel). Under the left part of
the rim sits the relief figure of a six-
legged crocodile. An “outline” of the
environment of the Nile Valley is repre-
sented by these figures.

Although leaning on Egyptian models
for its formal composition, this repre-
sentation of a man striding to the right
was certainly not created by an
Egyptian artist, as is evident from the
proportions. The figure holds a bow
and arrows in his left hand and a mace
in his right. A crown with a uraeus ser-
pent imitates the White Crown of
h crown and mace
are emblems of royalty. Since the stela
derives from an area of Buhen that was
primarily inhabited by Kerma peoples

portrays the king of Kerma.

Two large lion figures can be recon-

glazed faience tiles that were probably
set into the facade of the Eastern
Deffufa flanking the entrance.
Additional fragments indicate the
presence of other figures, including
bound prisoners and a hippopotamus.
The backs of the tiles show the
impressions of linen or basketry that
was used in their manufacture.
Fragments of cavetto cornices, torus
moldings, and plant motifs most likely
formed the decorative pattern along
the margins.

A diverse world of animals is shown in
these small cut-out figures of ivory or
mica. Mica, a siliceous mineral includ-
ed in flaky layers within hard stones, is
found, among other places, in the
Wadi el-Hudi. While the ivory figures
served as inlays for pieces of furniture,
in particular for beds, the figures cut
out of mica were sewn onto caps and
other textiles. They were often discov-
ered in burials near the head of the
deceased. The selection of mica figures
includes both real animals and mytho-
logical creatures, for example, winged
giraffes, or the Egyptian goddess
Thoueris shown as a composite figure
with hippopotamus head, crocodile
back, and female human torso with
pendulous breasts. These figures are
almost identical to the ivory inlays, and
their similarity to the so-called magical
wands in Egypt suggests that they
served an apotropaic function, and
were intended to ward off evil.

The motif of the raging lion attacking a
desert animal is a favorite metaphor for
the triumph of the Egyptian pharaoh
over the enemies of his kingdom. In this
ax blade from a tomb at Semna it is pos-
sible that the ibex, surprised by the royal
lion from behind, symbolizes the van-
quished Nubians. The piece shows work-
manship of high quality in its overall

and the paralyzed expression of the ibex.

Two bronze legs from a funerary bed
were found in the tomb of a minor
queen of King Shabitko. They were
resting in depressions prepared for
them around a stone coffin bench
which once held the body of the
deceased. The lower portion of this leg
is a square box with gently sloping
sides. On each of these, a wide mold-
ing surrounds the central motif of a
papyrus thicket, reproduced in its clas-
sical hieroglyphic form. Corrosion has
attacked all four sides, where pins of a
different metallic composition, perhaps
nails, have been driven through the
walls. The upper portion of the bed leg
has four sides, is hollow, and widens
toward the top. It terminates in an arc
with square holes piercing all four sides
to take the bedframe.

The upper portion of the bed leg
grows out of the back of a goose,
which nestles down on the box sup-
port. Its feathers were finely chased
after the form was cast. The head and
pointed beak are examples of particu-
larly fine artistic and technical work-
manship.

The significance of this motif lies in
one of the god Amun's many divine
forms. In Egypt from the New
Kingdom on, he is often represented
as a goose. Furthermore, in the
Pyramid Texts of the Old Kingdom, the
deceased utters the desire to ascend to
heaven as a goose. And in New
Kingdom royal tombs, wooden figures
of geese are found among the images
of deities buried with the deceased in
order to accompany him to the next
world.

MORE THAN A CENTURY OF

ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH IN THE SUDAN

SALAH MOHAMMED AHMED

Continent, is also one chest regions in archae-
ological remains. Its location, extending from the south-
ern frontiers of Egypt in the north to the equatorial belt
in the south and from the Red Sea coast in the east to the
African interior in the west, enriches the country with dif-
ferent climates and a variety of ethnic groups and popu-
lations. The Sudan has always played the role of a
“meeting place for different peoples and cultures. In the
past, it was the “meeting ground between the
“Mediterranean world and the heart of Africa. The Nile
-passage has constituted from the earliest times a vital
route through which people, goods, and ideas circulated
between north and south. This fact is clearly reflected in

the modern-day Sudan, a country inhabited by hundreds -

of tribes and ethnic groups with different cultural back-
grounds. However, two main sources of cultural influence
can be noted: the Arab-lslamic world and Central Africa.
The Sudan and its role in the development of the
region's civilization have been of a certain interest to the
outside world since very ancient times. Before the begin-
ning of the modern era of archaeological investigations in
the last century, the country was known in many works by
Greek, Roman, Byzantine, and Arab writers. The Greeks
used the term “Aethiopia” to designate the regions lying
to the south of Egypt, though it clearly did not apply to a
specific ethnic group or a well defined geographical terri-
tory. By using the term, the Greeks were probably referring
to different populations with brown “burnt-faces"" occu-
pying the regions south of the First Cataract. The land of
""Aethiopia” was described in many works of the classical
writers starting from the Sth century 8.c. onward—
Herodotus wrote his description of Meroe about 430 B.c.

Among those who wrote about the Sudan we can men-

tion Diodorus Siculus, Strabo, Dio Cassius, and Pliny.""
To illustrate the relationship between the ancient
Sudan and the Mediterranean world, it is worth men-

sae ticay

tioning two antiquities found in the country. The first one
is a column drum found at Meroe, now preserved in
Liverpool. Some scholars think that the Greek alphabet
inscribed on this drum was used for the education of
Meroitic children. The second object is a Latin inscription
from Musawwarat es-Sufra.2

The period of the region’s conversion to
Christianity, the sixth century a.p., is well documented in
the writing of many church historians. Among these the
works of John of Ephesus are particularly important.3 The
Arab-Islamic invasion of Egypt in a.p. 641 brought Nubia
to the attention of Arab historians. The conversion of the
country to Islam and the establishment of the Funj
Kingdom of Sennar in the sixteenth century marked an
era of a very rich local literature on the political, religious,
and economic conditions in the country.4

This knowledge of the country acquired from clas-
sical and later literature encouraged many travelers to visit
the Sudan and document its monuments during the eigh-
teenth and nineteenth centuries. James Bruce, arriving
from Ethiopia along the Blue Nile in 1722, visited many of
the archaeological sites between Sennar and the Egyptian
frontier. He was the first to identify the ruins of Begraweya
with ancient Meroe. Later on, J.-L. Burckhardt visited the
region and described its peoples and monuments.§

The Turkish governor of Egypt, Muhammad Alli
Pacha, who claimed the independance of Egypt from the
Ottoman Empire, decided to annex the Sudan to his
kingdom. He sent his armies to the country and put an
end to the Funj Kingdom of Sennar in 1821. This inva-
sion marked a very important point in the history of
archaeological research in the Sudan. Various European
adventurers accompanied the army. Interested in archae-
ology, these travelers documented and studied many of
the country’s monuments. The most important of these
pioneers is the Frenchman Ff. Cailliaud, who made
descriptions, plans, and drawings of many of Sudan's

monumental sites.” Among the travellers it is also impor-
tant to mention Linant de Bellefonds,8 Waddington and
Hanbury,? and Hoskins.'9 In the 1830s, the Italian medicial
doctor Ferlini undertook his famous treasure hunt at
Meroe, destroying some of its pyramids. However, the
work of the Prussian expedition under the direction of K.-
R. Lepsius (1842-1844) is considered to be the most
important step toward a scientific handling of the archae-
ological sites of the region.""! This mission carried out a full
scientific documentation of almost all the existing monu-
ments from the frontier of Egypt to the region of
Khartoum in the south. The second half of the last century
constituted a gap in the history of archaeological research
in the Sudan. The political situation in the country during
the Mahadist Revolution (1881-1898) had left the Sudan
in almost complete isolation from the outside world. No
archaeologists or travelers visited the country until its final
reconquest by British and Egyptian armies in 1898.

The present century has witnessed, since its begin-
ning, a considerable development of archaeological
research in Nubia. This is manifested in organized, sys-
tematic archaeological campaigns, the work of many mis-
sions, and a remarkable evolution of the legislative and
administrative institutions of antiquities in the Sudan.

Three systematic archaeological campaigns have
been organized in Nubia since the beginning of this cen-
tury. These were the result of the building and the sub-
sequent heightening of the Aswan Dam near the First
Cataract and the necessity to rescue the monuments and
the sites then endangered by rising waters.

The Aswan Dam was built between 1898 and
1902. In 1907, the Egyptian government decided to
increase its storage capacity. This decision endangered
both banks of the Nile in the area between the First
Cataract and Wadi es-Sebua. Many important sites and
monuments were going to be covered, forever, by the
rising water of the heightened dam. As a result the first
archaeological campaign was organized (1907-1911) to
rescue the region's antiquities. The first season of the
campaign was directed by G.-A. Reisner, while the sub-
sequent seasons were directed by C.-M. Firth.12

More than forty cemeteries were excavated, in addi-
tion to some fortresses, of which the most irnportant were
those of Ikkur and Kuban. The study and the classification
of the tombs and their grave goods enabled Reisner and his
colleagues to establish a sequence of evolution for the

Nubian cultures. In the absence of a resemblance er
horizons from Egypt, these cultures were given alpha ,
cal designations: A-Group, B-Group, C-Group, and is

to Dal, a few kilometers south of the Second Cataract.

b) The dismantling and transportation of some of
the region's monuments and their re-erection in the gar-

The present century also witnessed a considerable
number of individual archaeological expeditions and a
remarkable development of the legislative and adminis-
trative organisms of archaeology in the Sudan. With the
end of the Mahadist Revolution and the Anglo-Egyptian
colonization of the Sudan in 1898, the country became
accessible to archaeologists, who started roaming the
region to study its sites and monuments.

The British administration (1898-1956) encour-
aged scientists to come to the Sudan, and from the early
years of the century appointed an official to look after
the antiquities of the country. At the beginning this task
was often given to the Director of Education or one of
his assistants, who did the job alongside his primary
occupation. However, a permanent post, commissioner
for archaeology, was created in 1939 and A.-J. Arkell
was the first appointment. The British administration
issued the first law controlling archaeological activity in
1905. This law developed into the “Antiquities
Ordinance” which was amended in 1952 and has
remained in force to the present day.

The Antiquities Service, now the National
Corporation for Antiquities and Museums (NCAM), is
presently a department of the Ministry of Environment
and Tourism. It is the government's organ responsible for
the excavation, protection, and exhibition of Sudan's cul-
tural heritage. It consists of three main departments:
Fieldwork, Restoration, and Museums. In addition to
uncovering and preserving sites and monuments, the
NCAM is very active in the field of exhibiting the mate-
rial culture of the Sudan's rich heritage. At the present

day, the department runs the following museums:

1, The Sudan National Museum, opened in Khartoum in 1972.
An archaeological museum, it exhibits monuments and objects repre-
senting the cultural development of the country from prehistoric times
to the Islamic period.

2. The Khalifa House Museum at Omdurman. This was the resi-
dence of the successor of the Mahadi (1885-1898). It has been trans-
formed into a museum exhibiting objects related to the Mahadist
Revolution and the Anglo-Egyptian administration.

3. The Ethnographical Museum in Khartoum. It exhibits ethno-
graphical objects of the different tribes and ethnic groups of the country.

4. The Museum of Shaikan at El-Obied. This is a regional museum
in the capital of the state of Kordofan (western Sudan). It exhibits
archaeological objects from the different periods of the country’s history,
together with ethnographical material.

5. The Sultan Ali Dinar Palace Museum. This is the residence of
the Sultan Ali Dinar, one of the commanders of the Mahadist Revolution
who escaped the Battle of Omdurman (1898) and established a small
kingdom in western Sudan which survived until 1916. The palace lies in
the town of El-Fasher, the capital of Darfour (western Sudan). The
museum exhibits objects of this period in addition to archaeological
material illustrating the different phases of the history of the Sudan.

Other museums are planned at Gebel Barkal,
Meroe, and elsewhere.

The official awareness of the importance of archae-
ology is not only manifested in the development of the leg-

islative and administrative fields and the opening of muse-
ums, but can be also noticed in the field of education. In the
eatly 1960s, a Department of Archaeology was created
within the Faculty of Arts at the University of Khartoum.
Another Faculty of Heritage and Archeology was estab-
lished at Kereima, near Gebel Barkal, in 1992. At first, this
was a branch of the Wadi el-Neel (Nile Valley) University cen-
tred at El-Damer. Now it has been transformed into a
Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences and linked to the newly
established University of Dongola. Another Department of
Archaeology is also planned within the University of Shendi.
Since its establishment at the beginning of the
century, the Antiquities Service has followed a clear pol-
icy of encouraging archaeological missions to uncover
the hidden and buried history of the country. In the north
of the country and concurrent with the first Nubian
archaeological campaign (1907-1911), the expedition of
the University of Pennsylvania excavated the sites of
Ereika (1907),!5 Karanog, and Shablul.16 At the same
time, G. S. Mileham carried out a survey of churches in
Lower Nubia.17 Later on, Steindorff, at the head of the
Ernst von Sieglin Expedition of Leipzig, worked at Aniba

limited excavations at Gebel Barkal and Meroe. In 1907,
he published his book The Egyptian Sudan. . . .7""
Archaeological activity in the central Sudan also includes
the tours and reports of J.-W. Crowfoot? and P. D. Scott-
Moncrieff.23 In 1909, J. Garstang carried out the first
extensive excavations at Meroe,24 and Sir H. Wellcome
excavated the site of Gebel Moya in the period
1911-14.25 Under the direction of Griffith, the Oxford
Expedition in Nubia excavated at Faras (1910-1 2).26
Later on they excavated the temple of Taharga, the
Napatan cemetery, and a small part of the Napatan town
of Sanam Abu Dom.2? Finally they worked on the temple
complex of Kawa.28

The coming of G.-A. Reisner, who directed the
first season of the first archaeological campaign of Nubia
(1907-8), at the head of the expedition of Harvard
University and the Museum of Fine Arts of Boston
marked a very important phase of the study of the his-
tory of the Sudan. In the period from 1913 to 1932, this
mission excavated at the site of Kerma south of the Third
Cataract; the temples and pyramids of Gebel Barkal, the
royal cemeteries of Nuri, Kurru, and Meroe; and a group
of Egyptian fortresses near the Second Cataract.

At Kerma, Reisner brought to light one of Africa's
most ancient kingdoms.29 Although most of the antiqui-
ties on the site were wrongly attributed to the Egyptian
occupants of the Middle Kingdom, the material yielded by
the site and the standard of the documentation were
essential for the later studies of this civilization, which is
now considered as a purely Nubian achievement. The
study of the royal tombs at Kurru,30 Nuri,3? Gebel Barkal,32
and Meroe32 enabled Reisner to reconstruct Kushite his-
tory. A royal succession from the ninth century B.c. to the
fourth century A.o. was then worked out. In the period
1928-32, the mission excavated the Egyptian fortresses of
Shelfak, Uronarti, Mirgissa, Semna, and Kumma.*4

Little archaeological work was undertaken in the
1930s and 1940s. The economic crisis and the Second
World War were largely responsible for this gap in the
history of archaeological research in the region. We have
already mentioned the second heightening of the Aswan
Dam and the archaeological salvage campaign
(1929-1934) organized to rescue the monuments of
Nubia, then endangered by the rising water of the lake
formed in front of the dam. At the same time, U.
Monneret de Villard completed the survey of the Lower

Nubian churches started by Mileham at the beginning of
the century.2> A very important work realized during the
1940s is considered to be the foundation for prehistoric
studies in the Sudan. This was A. J. Arkell's excavations
at the Paleolithic site of Khor Abu Anga,3® the Mesolithic
site of Khartoum,3”? and the Neolithic site of Esh-
Shaheinab.38 At the same time O. H. Myers from the
Gordon Memorial College of Khartoum conducted his
excavations at the prehistoric site of Abka.39
Considerable archaeological research was con-
ducted in the years following the Second World War up
to the present day. It is important to mention here the
work conducted by P. L. Shinnie at the monastery of
Ghazali,4° the post-Meroitic tumuli of Tangasi,4! and
Soba East.42 The Sudan Antiquities Service conducted
the excavation of the site of Wad ban Naga under the
direction of J. Vercoutter and Thabit H. Thabit at the end
of the 1950s.43 During almost the same period, the
Humboldt University, Berlin surveyed the Butana region
and undertook excavations at Musawwarat es-Sufra.44
Further work on the prehistory of the Butana was carried
out later on by the University of Texas and the University
of Khartoum.45 In the north, excavations have been con-
ducted at Mirgissa and Sai Island4® by the French
Mission, by the Expedition of M. Schiff-Giorgini at
Soleb,4”7 and by the Foundation Blackmer and the
University of Geneva on Argo Island.48 In the 1960s the
University of Khartoum started, with the University of
Calgary, the excavation of the town site of Meroe,49
under the direction of P. L. Shinnie, who had previously
participated in the activities of the Egypt Exploration
Society in Nubia.5° The creation of the French
Archaeological Unit in the 1970s was a great achieve-
ment that permitted the Sudan Antiquities Service to
conduct rescue work in different parts of the country.
Nowadays, the National Corporation — for
Antiquities and Museums (NCAM) is cooperating with
more than twenty missions conducting field researches
in different parts of the country. The following sites and
regions are presently under investigation:
Sai Island (The French Archaeological Mission of the Island of Sai),
Sadeinga (Sadeinga Archaeological Unit, France), Soleb (IFAO, France),
the Third Cataract Region (University of Khartoum and University of
Newcastle), Kerma (University of Geneva), Kadruka (The French Section
of the NCAM), Gism Arbaa (University of Lille), Kawa-Khandag (The
Sudan Archaeological Research Society [SARS], England), Old Dongola

(University of Warsaw), Latti Basin (Royal Ontario Museum), Gebel
Barkal (University of Rome; Museum of Fine Arts, Boston; and the Clos

Foundation, Spain), El Arab (University of Cassino, Italy and the
NCAM), Hamdab (Museum of Gdansk, Poland), Begrawey-Atbara
region (SARS, England), Meroe (University of Khartoum and Humboldt
University), Musawwarat es-Sufra (Humboldt University), Naga (the
Egyptian Museum of Berlin), Geili (The University of Rome), Kadero
(Museum of Poznan, Poland), the region of the right bank of the Blue
Nile (University of Madrid), Kassala and the Gash Delta (University of
Naples), the eastern desert (The Eastern Desert Research Center, Italy),
and the Libyan desert (University of Cologne).

From the above-mentioned survey of archaeologi-
cal investigations in the Sudan, we note the concentration
of such activity on the banks of the Nile. However, scien-
tific work is currently being conducted in new areas in the
eastern Sudan, along the Red Sea coast, in the Gash Delta,
and in the eastern desert. Only brief fieldwork had previ-
ously been undertaken in this region by the Universities ot
Lyon and Khartoum. Very little work has been undertaken
in the west and south of the country; the only investiga-
tions, both realized in the 1980s, were by the University of
Hamburg at Gebel Marra in Darfour and by the British
Institute in East Africa (Nairobi) in the southern Sudan.

The Fieldwork Section of the NCAM is active in con-
ducting salvage operations, alone or with foreign missions,
to rescue the cultural heritage of the country which is more
and more endangered by the rapid economic and social
development of the Sudan. The corporation is reviving its
restoration project for the pyramids of Meroe with the
technical and scientific help of Dr. F. Hinkel. A similar pro-
ject for the protection and restoration of the port of Suakin
on the Red Sea is being prepared. The NCAM welcomes all
efforts of individuals and institutions to participate in the
uncovering, protection, and exhibition of the Sudan's cul-
tural heritage, which is truly the heritage of all mankind.

6,000 YEARS AGO

REMARKS ON THE PREHISTORY OF THE SUDAN

JAcQues REINOLD & LECH KRZYZANIAK

he study of Sudanese prehistory is still in its infancy.

After rather timid beginnings during the Second
World War, prehistoric investigations did not gather
momentum until the 1960s, as a result of the
international campaign for the salvation of Nubian
monuments. Nevertheless, many regions of the vast
territory of the Sudan, whose surface area corresponds
to a quarter of the entire European continent, remain to
this day terra incognita. It would be presumptuous to
claim that the outlines of individual cultures and their
chronologies are settled beyond dispute.

The Paleolithic

Located west of the East African rift valley and
thought to be the birthplace of humanity, the Sudan
plays a direct role in the earliest stages of human
evolution, an “East Side Story,” as it is sometimes called.
The first traces of humanity probably do not extend back
further than about 300,000 years. There are hand-axes
of flint from a slightly differentiated early Acheulean era.
This was followed during a moister period about 70,000
years ago by the middle Paleolithic, giving rise to the
cultures known to specialists as the Levallois and
Mousterian. Hunting and fishing were the primary
sources of survival, and aurochs were among the animals
hunted. The late Paleolithic comes to a close around
40,000 s.r. with characteristic types of stone blades and
microliths, small flint implements. The cool, dry climate
of this era concentrated human activity in the river
valleys, as is evident from the finds at sites along the
Atbara and the Blue Nile. Whether the White Nile joined
with the Blue Nile near modern Khartoum during this dry
phase remains doubtful.

From this period until about 10,000 years ago, an
increasing differentiation between _ individual
Epipaleolithic cultural spheres sets in. The stone tools
display numerous similarities to cultures in the Maghreb,

the Levant, and central Africa. Evidence of well-
developed fishing techniques is also noteworthy.

A fundamental shift in climatic conditions
occurred in the eighth millennium s.c., giving rise on
both sides of the Nile Valley to a steppe landscape. The
Wadi Howar in northwest Sudan became a succession of
rivers and lakes. At this time, the present climate of the
southern Sudan stretched some five hundred kilometers
farther north, allowing human habitation in what are
now desert zones, partially in stable settlements along
river courses and partially in seasonally occupied camps.
In the eighth millennium s.c., sites in Khartoum
(Khartoum Hospital) and near the Sixth Cataract (Saqqai)
present clues for the first developmental phases of
ceramics, for which there is no corresponding evidence
at such an early age in the Egyptian Nile Valley. Fishing,
hunting, and the gathering of plants and fruits were the
means of survival in this moist environment. The thin-
walled, partially large-format pottery is primarily
decorated with wavy lines, to which dotted patterns
were later added. This decoration is found much earlier
throughout the entire south Saharan region, from
Mauritania to the East African lakes. Based on the dating
of the most recent discoveries in the central Sudan,
however, the assumption that we are dealing here with
a homogenous cultural zone cannot be confirmed.

The Neolithic Revolution

Since the more recent excavation results from
both the western and eastern Sudan are only partially
accessible in incomplete reports, our overview of
developments in the fifth and fourth millennia §.c. will
have to concentrate primarily on the two regions that
have traditionally been studied most intensively: the
central Sudan, from Atbara to about a hundred
kilometers south of Khartoum, and Nubia from the

Despite the minute scale of this figure
of Isis with the Horus child on her lap,
the workmanship is rich in detail. The
sides of the throne display woven pat-

unification of the Two Lands. The god-

North of the first pylon of the Great
Amun Temple at Gebel Barkal, a statue
cache was excavated, producing many
discarded Statues that had once
belonged to the temple's inventory.
Among them was this very dynamic
image of King Tanutamani, broken into
several fragments and _ still headless
today. In its formal composition, the
piece follows the traditional Egyptian
Pattern of the Standing/striding figure,
combining repose and movement or,
as Thomas Mann so masterfully put it,
“stationary in motion, and mobile in
Stasis,”

Stylistically, the statue is an excellent
€xample of Kushite art, with its wide
shoulders and muscular modeling in
the long legs. The iconography also
displays Kushite elements, such as the
three ram's heads (later removed)
hanging from a cord around the neck.

The classic sphinx form, consisting of a
lion’s body with human head and royal
headdress, is foreign to the art of
Napata. There the preference is for the
variant with a mane (attested several
times for Tahargo), or a sphinx with
human arms and hands, as we have
seen above on the sphinx of
Shepenwepet (cat. 168). The sphinx of
Senkamanisken, discovered in the stat-
ue cache of the great Amun Temple,
wears the royal headdress with double
uraeus and surmounted by the Double
Crown. The latter has lost its original
significance as a crown of Upper and
Lower Egypt, becoming a symbol of
royal dignity.

The transition from the front paws of a
lion to human arms seems to occur at
the elbows. The boldly stylized muscu-
lature of the upper arms is apparently
still part of the lion; similar deep
grooves indicating muscles are visible
On the hind legs.

In its human hands the sphinx holds a
Conical vessel inscribed with the ruler’s
names in cartouches. As with the
standing statue of King Senkama-
nisken (cat. 229), the face here is
uNcompromisingly “African.”

This just under life-size statue of the
wife of King Senkamanisken is one of
the great artistic masterpieces of the
kingdom of Napata. It absorbs an
ancient Egyptian statue type and inte-
grates it completely into an original
stylistic concept; one might consider by
way of analogy the relationship of a
Greek kuros to its formal predecessor
in the Egyptian striding figure.

The slightly striding pose of the left
foot, the upraised left hand under the
breast, and the right arm hugging the
body are all formal elements of grace-
ful female statuary of the New
Kingdom. They are adopted and
extended in the images of so-called
divine votaresses of the Twenty-fifth
Dynasty. This type forms the frame-
work of Amanimalel’s statue, around
which the corpulent volumes of the
figure are developed. The full thighs
and hips, the firm breasts above the
very high waist, and two delineated
folds gently hinting at stomach model-
ing all appear naked, but are actually
wrapped in a close-fitting garment.
The seam, drawn and partially red,
runs from the left shoulder under the
right armpit, leaving the right breast
free, and is also visible over the feet
and wrists. A vertical line from the left
foot over the leg to the left breast indi-
cates the garment's fringe.

The rough state of the surface does
not indicate an unfinished condition,
but rather serves as a coarse base for
the addition of a colorful layer, proba-

THE KINGDOM OF

bly of silver. This is revealed by the fact
that the body parts not covered by the
dress—the hands and feet—do indeed
show a finely polished surface. The
sandal straps were probably gilded.

In her left hand Amanimalel holds a
small seated figure of a child with
Double Crown and sidelock, most like-
ly representing Harpocrates, or “Horus
the child.” In her right hand she holds
an aegis with a menit. The queen is
designated on the back pillar as
“beloved of Amun of Napata, who
resides in the sacred mountain.” An
artistic vision of womanhood personi-
fied, which began with the idols of the
Neolithic and was developed further in
the clay figurines of the A-Group and
C-Group, reaches it culmination in this
statue of the fullest maturity.

With 1,277 shabtis, King Senkama-
nisken exceeded by far the number of
shabtis placed not far from his pyramid
in the tomb of his grandfather Tahargo
(cats. 201-220). In size and quality,
however, they must take second place
behind the large-format examples in
different stones prepared by the earlier
king. One of the five groups of
Senkamanisken’s shabtis, each of
which differs in material and iconogra-
phy, is made of light green faience and
lacks all royal attributes. The tripartite
wig is not only the standard hairstyle
for shabtis, but for the deceased in
general.

CYLINDER SHEATHS

In nine royal tombs at Nuri the excava-
tors found cylinder sheaths of precious
metals whose function remains a mys-
tery. In Aspelta’s tomb alone fifteen
examples were unearthed. One sheath
was found at Meroe (Beg. S 85).

The sheaths are assembled from two
pieces: a lower cylinder, sealed at the
base with a round disk, and a shorter
open cylinder placed over an internal
sleeve on the lower piece. On the gild-
ed silver sheet there is sometimes addi-
tional decoration in applied gilded,
silver, or gold wire, or granulated gold
bands; inlays in semi-precious stones
are attested in one example (cat. 258).
The wide range of quality reveals that
a variety of goldsmiths, certainly local,
were at work here. The rich icono-
graphic variations are chased and

sometimes modeled by repoussé.

The latter wears the “Kushite cap”
with double uraeus and diadem, as
well as the royal ram’s-head neck orna-
ment, a broad collar, armlets, bra-
celets, and crossed bands on his
forearms. Beneath the triangular cen-
tral tab of his kilt is a calf-length gar-
ment with a fringed seam through
which his legs are visible. The king's
sandals are bowed at the toes. Above
him hovers the sun-disk with uraeus
and outspread wings forming a right
angle. King and god each extend a
hand to the other, while the king's left
hand is raised to the god in a gesture
of recitation. The reciprocal, interde-
pendent relationship between the god
and the king, and their close coopera-

The tradition of covering the fingers
and toes of the mummified body with
gold sheaths is well-attested in Egypt.
Excavation of both the treasure of
Tutankhamun and the royal tombs of
Tanis produced many examples similar
to these from the tomb of Queen
Asata, a wife of King Aspelta. Each
one is fashioned from a single piece of
gold sheet. The depressions represent-
ing the nails were filled with colored

paste.

Mirrors with decorated figural handles
are known from the reigns of Shabako
and Amani-natake-lebte. Nastasens
mirror presents the highpoint of these
examples of the goldsmith’s craft. The
slightly oval bronze disk was polished
on both sides. Set into a sickle-shaped
support of silver representing a Cres
cent moon, the disk becomes an image
of the moon. The mirror’s handle takes
the form of a column with a papyrus
capital. Four sculptured deities stand
with their backs to the column.
Aligned with the front and back are
Amun in human form and the falcon-
headed Khons with crescent moon. On
the sides, beneath the sickle-shaped
support, stand the goddesses Mut,

with Double Crown, and Hathor, with
cow's horns. Between the capital and
the mirror’s disk is an abacus with the
name of Nastasen on each of its four
sides. The abacus mediates between
the realm of the earth, symbolized by
the papyrus, and that of heaven,
expressed by the lunar motif of the
mirror's disk.

Surrounding a column with  three-
dimensional figures is a concept for-
eign to Egyptian art but attested
several times in Meroitic architecture,
for example in the great complex of
Musawwarat es-Sufra.

Khartoum, National Museum 24705

One of the most important discoveries
for the art history of the Sudan in
recent decades was made by a Swiss
expedition to Tago, on the island of
Argo, led by Charles Maystre. In
January, 1974, a gilded bronze statue
came to light in a small pit within the
court of the great temple. Apparently
hidden there, this piece is not only the
largest metal sculpture of the Sudan,
but it also reveals a previously
unknown dimension of Napatan and
Meroitic art. Among its extraordinary
features are the unusually lively expres-
sion created by the inlaid eyes, and the
lifelike sense of motion.

The male figure strides forward with
left arm gently extended before the
body and hand below the waist. The
right forearm reaches into free space.
The freedom of motion and resulting
dynamic effect is allowed by the use of
metal, which eliminates any need for
supporting structures for the arms. The
pose of the left arm may be explained
by a minor iconographic detail. A
thumb ring is shown on the right
thumb (cf. cat. 271), part of the equip-
ment often worn by archers. From this
we can discern that the left hand held
a bow. The forearm guard on the left
arm is also part of the archer’s accou-
trements.

This archer is a king. The Kushite cap
with double uraeus and diadem, the
cord necklace with three ram’s head
amulets, and the kilt are all royal

THE KINGDOM OF

attributes. A broad collar, earrings, and
upper armbands complete the jewelry,
and the figure wears sandals.

A layer of plaster was added to the
metal surface, which was roughened
with punches. Along with the differen-
tiated surface modeling, the plaster
served as a ground for the gilding that
covered the entire body, giving the
impression that the statue was made
of solid gold.

The statue was probably buried toward
the end of the pre-Christian era, per-
haps to protect it from enemy invasion.
By this time it had apparently already
lost a significant portion of its gilding,
for its date of manufacture was con-
siderably earlier. Stylistically, the figure
dates to c. 200 B.c., corresponding
directly with its stocky, extremely pow-
erful proportions to the tradition
favored by Napatan sculpture. The
facial features—especially the small,
pouting mouth—find their closest par-
allels in the reliefs of the precisely
dated Lion Temple of Musawwarat es-
Sufra.

The existence of this figure, found at
Tabo, far from the religious and politi-
cal centers, suggests that an equally
costly statue inventory once belonged
to the temples of Napata or the new
capital city of Meroe. But as the sort of
portable articles particularly favored by
temple thieves, such statues have not
survived the millennia.

Khartoum, National Museum 24397

Since the very beginnings of Egyptian
history, a diverse symbolic repertory for
representing the destruction of ene-
mies was an integral part of the reign-
ing king's ideology. Egypt's foes were
separated into three groups: Asiatics,
Libyans, and Nubians. With the
Nubians’ adoption of numerous motifs
from Egyptian art, this pictorial sym-
bolism finds its way into royal repre-
sentations of Napatan and Meroitic
art. From being enemy of a constantly
triumphant pharaoh, the Nubian ruler
has now risen to the position of king
himself. In Kushite temple reliefs, long
rows of enemies taken prisoner by the
king are sometimes modeled directly
upon Egyptian reliefs of the New
Kingdom. The temple of Amenhotep Ill
at Soleb is a good example, and many
other models for inspiration were
probably available on the New
Kingdom temple walls at Gebel Barkal.
Anachronisms creep into the scenes
because of this copy work, representa-
tions of peoples who have long since
disappeared from the historical stage.
In many scenes, however, the image of
the enemy is updated, with two
groups receiving particular attention: a
central African or Nilotic type, and an
ethnic group characterized by its coif-
fure of stiffly vertical, middle-length
hair. This second representation seems
to portray the Bedouin Bedja of the
eastern desert, who probably posed a
constant threat.

MEROE

On the basis of the presence of the
hairstyle described above, the prisoner
figure from Tabo belongs to this ethnic
group. He is shown kneeling with his
elbows bound behind the back. The
bonds run diagonally over the
hindquarters to the ankles, tying the
body up like a package. The feet are
crushed beneath the shins. The head
leans horizontally backward, and a
hole is drilled through the neck
between the collarbones, going down
to the base of the statue

Two reliefs on the back of the pylon of
the Lion temple at Naga (see fig. 43,
p. 266) provide the explanation for this
detail. A long, sharp lance has been
driven into the body of a bound pris-
oner shown in identical pose, and the
lion-god Apedemak sits upon it. The

274

statue proves that this motif was not
simply invented for relief representa-
tions but also formed Part of the deco-
rative program for temples, executed
in brutal three-dimensional realism.

= or several millennia the high cultures of Nubia did
without a written form of their language, even
though they were probably well aware from their close
contact with Egypt of the diverse possibilities and uses of
writing. Except for personal names and place-names, no
attempts to write the Nubian language with Egyptian
hieroglyphs are known. Only in the second century B.c.
do inscribed monuments appear in the Meroitic region
displaying the language of the inhabitants in their own
script.

Meroitic is written by means of a “hieroglyphic”
and a “cursive” script; both contain a selection of
Egyptian hieroglyphic and demotic signs. The writing sys-
tem also derives from one of those already in use in
Egyptian texts of the kingdom of Napata for the writing
of non-Egyptian words. As evidence to suggest that such
a system might be used for the composition of entire
texts, we have from Egypt the example of a papyrus of
the Persian period with Aramaic texts in demotic script.
After the elimination of superfluous elements, such as
duplicate signs and determinatives, in the context of an
apparently well-conceived “reform,” the Meroitic writing
system (fig. 42) possessed fifteen consonantal signs, four
syllabic signs (for ne, se, te and to), and four vowel signs,
of which two designate the vowels i and o/u respective-
ly, one has an e or vowel-less value and one an initial e.
In medial position, a is not expressed by a particular sign,
although it is unclear if a consonantal sign without a fol-
lowing vowel sign must always be read as consonant
plus a. The similarity to the ancient Persian writing sys-
tem is noteworthy, although this need not indicate any
common dependence of “invention.” Between the
words, and even between grammatical elements, stands
a word divider; like the numerical signs, this is of
Egyptian origin.

Inscribed Meroitic monuments include a number
of royal texts (the oldest on a stela of King Taneyidamani

253

MEROITIC WRITING AND LANGUAGE

from around 100 8.c.); others are captions beside people
and deities in the wall scenes of pyramid chapels and
temples, as well as a great number of mortuary texts on
stelae and offering stones. There are also “pilgrim
inscriptions” on temple walls. Inscriptions carved in stone
(cat. 284) are also written primarily in cursive script, but
the form of their signs and their development clearly
show that this script was mostly intended for texts on
Papyrus and potsherds, of which only a few examples are
known. In addition to its use in religious contexts,
Meroitic was without doubt also the written language of
both the administration and of daily life.

The variety of preserved inscribed monuments is
SO great that we can assume both knowledge and use of
writing for a significant portion of the population. Since
the decipherment of the writing system by F. LI. Griffith
at the beginning of the twentieth century, a comprehen-
sive body of source material is now at hand for the
Meroitic Period of the kingdom. Its value, however, is
certainly weakened by the fact that the texts can be
read, but not translated. A few basic rules of the linguis-
tic structure are recognizable, showing that Meroitic
might belong to a group of northern Sudanese lan-
guages to which Nubian is also ascribed. But the chrono-
logical and genetic distance from these languages is sO
great that not much help can be expected by making
comparisons. The meaning of divine and personal
names, place-names, and individual titles can be
grasped, especially in those cases that stem from
Egyptian. Among these are words like annata (“priest”),
plamusa (“leader"" or “general""), and a very few addi-
tional nouns such as ato (""water""), at (“bread”), and
certain kinship terms such as wil (“to be someone's
brother”). The most accessible are the funerary texts,
with their fixed progression of formulae and series of
titles. But it is precisely the long royal inscriptions, in

which narratives of historical events are to be expected,
that elude our every attempt at comprehension.

As a written language, Meroitic outlasted the end
of the state. The latest “historical” inscription belongs to
one of the post-Meroitic Nobade kings of the fourth or
fifth century a.p. (the inscription of Kharamadoye in
Kalabsha). Three Meroitic signs were adopted into the
otherwise Greek script of Old Nubian.

To expect to fill in this dearth of source material
from the kingdom of Kush with texts from contemporary
Egypt is a dim hope. But we could mention here the
Egyptian narratives of King Psametek II from the Twenty-
sixth Dynasty concerning his Nubian campaign of 591 8.c.
To these might be added the demotic graffiti on the walls
of Lower Nubian temples from the second to fourth cen-
turies a.b., which provide interesting glimpses into the

255

LANGUAGE

relations of the court in Meroe and the Meroitic ruling
class active in Lower Nubia to the cult of Isis in Philae.
An important contribution to our picture of
“Ethiopia” should be expected from Greek and Roman
authors. Fragments of such a picture are provided by
Herodotus; from the reign of Ptolemy II onward, writings
on “Ethiopia” are available, with participants in expeditions
to the south recording their observations. But with the
exception of isolated quotations from the works of Bion of
Soli (third century B.c.), these texts are, of course, all lost.
The same fate befell the works of the Greek geographers,
who were the first to evaluate these treatises for their
descriptions of the world. Only Eratosthenes is worthy of
mention here. Even the authors of the Roman Imperial
Period such as Strabo and Pliny are for our purposes little
more than preservers of an ancient corpus of quotations.

The ram-headed Amun, the most
important deity of the Nubian/
Sudanese Nile Valley, can be traced as
far back as the Kerma Culture. This
remains the representation of choice
for the god in the Meroitic Period as
well, differentiated at the various cult
centers only by his crowns. This granite
figure once wore a separately mounted
crown on top of the low cylindrical
headpiece. The transition from human
body to ram's head is hidden by a tri-
partite wig. The typical horns of Amun
are visible on both sides of the head,
curving in a semicircular fashion
around the ears. The eyes were once
inlaid. The marginally differentiated
modeling of the body makes the previ-
ously suggested Napatan date unlikely;
a creation date during the Meroitic
Period is preferable.

Only by accident has this monumental
ram figure joined the Sudan exhibition.
It belongs to an ensemble of twelve
identical ram statues lining the proces-
sional approach to the Amun Temple
at Naga. Six were set up before the
kiosk at the upper end of the ramp,
and the other six between the kiosk
and entrance portal to the temple. One
of the statues was stolen in 1992, but
recovered soon after in the desert
south of Atbara. After being brought
to the Museum in Khartoum, it under-
went restoration, since the right side
had been intentionally damaged.
Before being returned to Naga, where
it will be set up once again in its origi-
nal location as part of the restoration
efforts by the Berlin Naga Expedition, it
was added to the Khartoum loan
objects for the exhibition.

The treatment of the ram‘s pelt with
spiral curls appears in the much coars-
er Meroitic ram figures at the entrance
to the Amun Temple at Meroe. The
ram figures of the New Kingdom from
Soleb (cat. 141) and those of Taharqo
from Kawa treat the pelt as drop-
shaped tufts, Beneath the ram’s face

In Egyptian religious iconography the
monkey is a commonly occurring form
of the god Thoth. This deity appears
frequently in the reliefs of Meroitic
pyramid chapels in the scenes of the
judgment of the dead (shown with an
ibis’s head), but is otherwise relatively
rare in Meroitic iconography. Caution
is perhaps advised in identifying this
monkey sculpture with Thoth since it is
apparently shown with arms
upraised—a pose frequently found on
monkeys associated with and praying
to the sun-god.

Monumental divine statues often
flanked the portals of Meroitic tem-

traces of yellow pigment and red pre-

belonged to such a statue. The taper-

a royal, representation. The Double

in the center is worn by the god
Sebiumeker, a purely Meroitic deity
unattested in Egypt.

The unfinished condition of this sand-
stone figure has led to wide specula-
tion. The trunk-like appendage on the
face may resemble an elephant, and
based on this vague association the
figure has been seen as evidence for
contact between the Meroitic
Kingdom and India. The role of the ele-
phant as Meroitic royal animal is well-
attested (cf. cat. 277), but it does not
appear in religious iconography; more-
over, the trunk is too short to represent
an elephant. All this speculation is
pointless, since the overinterpreted ele-
ment is quite simply the divine beard
which, like the entire figure, is unfin-
ished. An uncarved, unfinished bridge
leaves nose and beard connected. The
form of the crown identifies the figure
as the Meroitic god Sebiumeker
(cf. cat. 298, 300).

This bronze statue from Kawa displays
extraordinary technical and stylistic qual-
ity. Stylistic and iconographical factors
refute a dating alongside the Kushite
bronzes of Tahargo (|. Hofmann).
The figure shows the god Sebiumeker
(cf. cats. 298, 299) with the character-
istic bulge around the Double Crown
(here with the addition of a uraeus)
and divine beard. The costume consists
of a tripartite kilt and a feathered
corselet with shoulder ties. Armlets,
bracelets, a pectoral, and a necklace of
large spherical beads make up the
ostentatious jewelry. A wide double
streamer hangs from the crown down
the neck and back, extending all the
way to the belt. The left hand resting
by the side holds the sign for life
(ankh), while the extended right hand
once grasped a scepter.

Three relief figures are carved almost in
sculpture in the round within a frame,
of which the gently rounded jamb
from a door is visible at the bottom of
the fragment. Each of the two broken
halves of this block shows a torus
molding at its outer edge. The scene
itself is symmetrically composed. In the
center stands a female figure whose
mode of representation solves the
problem of presenting a three-dimen-
sional body in only two dimensions.
This is unattested in Egyptian art, but
recurs on a Stela in Boston (cat. 308).
The upper body (and most likely the
missing head as well) are shown

frontally. From the waist down, the
body, legs, and feet appear in profile,
marching left. Around the shoulders is
a scarf that falls over the right upper
arm. On each side is a goddess turned
toward the central figure and pouring
a libation with one hand while holding
a staff in the other. The motif of a
three-figure representation resembles
the triptychs with Osiris flanked by Isis
and Nephthys. In the place of the god
of resurrection, this fragment shows
the deceased queen. Based on the
provenance—Pyramid N 11 in the
northern cemetery of Meroe—she can
be identified as Shanakdakhete. A car-
touche too damaged to read appears
at left on the almost completely worn
surface of the doorjamb.

Egypto-Sudanese border to the region between the Third
and Fourth cataracts.

The second half of the sixth millennium B.c. is
distinguished by an increasingly dry climate. The origins
and groupings of the population are difficult to
reconstruct, since hardly any well-preserved skeletal
remains have been discovered. While in Lower Nubia the
late Paleolithic lifestyle develops further, in the central
Sudan hunting and fishing recede in favor of the keeping
of domesticated animals. Oxen, goats, sheep, and dogs
are descended from wild animals not indigenous to the
Nile Valley; thus it cannot be ruled out that they arrived
in the Sudan with populations from the Sahara.
Determining the presence of agriculture is also difficult:
the meager plant remains of millet sometimes found
inside pottery jars do not differ morphologically from
wild plants. Barley, on the other hand, is attested in
domesticated form since the middle of the fifth
millennium 8.c. Indirect evidence of the cultivation of
grain is provided by the large quantity of grinding stones
for the grinding of cereals found in many sites,

PREHISTORY OF THE SUDAN

Especially noteworthy are the bell-shaped vessels. Their
non-functional, widening shape, their rarity, and their
exclusively funerary contexts all suggest a ritual
association; they were probably used in mortuary
offering ceremonies for important individuals. The
consistently smoothed or polished surfaces bear rich
decoration, usually incised with a comb-like implement.
Scratch or dotted patterns in meandering or triangular
motifs are found alongside finely striped polish (later as
“ripple ware,"" a typical surface of A-Group ceramics).
Very rarely one even finds painted vessels. The only clear
exceptions are the stone vessels. We should also mention
here the female figurines, usually of fired clay, more
rarely of sandstone, that are often explained as fecundity
idols. Their occasionally extremely formal abstraction,
which barely reveals their gender, renders their function
more puzzling.

The type of site, either habitation or cemetery,
plays a fundamental role in its interpretation. If clear
indications of a settlement are present, individual
buildings are nevertheless hardly recognizable. Only in 4
few cases have hearths been identified. Human factors,
such as subsequent overbuilding or the quarrying of
fertile, phosphate-rich soil, and natural factors, such as
water and wind erosion, have destroyed the building
structures and eliminated all trace of workshops, trash
deposits, and shelters. For this reason, the investigation
of stone-age settlements is often limited to the collection
of individual finds in square, meter-sized sections and
just a few centimeters below surface level. In the place of
paleo-ethnological methods, as practiced today in
prehistoric research, a simple typological classification
used to be the typical approach. Thus it is
understandable why the interests of the excavators
focused above all on the funerary areas, which, as closed
archaeological complexes in often undisturbed context,
provide valuable information about lifestyle, economy,
social structure, and religious conceptions.

Sites in the central Sudan

Thanks to the initiative of A. J. Arkell, the pioneer
of prehistoric research in the Sudan, the central Sudan
has become the focus of prehistoric archaeology. A
chronological framework has been established here, one

the Khartoum Neolithic, named after its principal site of
es-Shaheinab, south of the Sixth Cataract. Following this
is the cultural phase of Kadada, shaped by a drier
climate. Two sites, from which objects in the present
exhibition may be seen, will now be described in greater
detail.

Kadero, about twenty kilometers north of
Khartoum, contains an early Neolithic settlement. In the
occupants’ trash heap at the edge of the mound were
found bones of both wild and domesticated animals and
fragments of millstones, stone implements, and ceramic
vessels. The actual settlement and stalls lay in the center
of the mound, and the cemetery was nearby. The Sioa Sree :
archaeological examination of both settlement and -_— » Tomb 60 (photograph: kK, Kroeper)
cemetery of a single population group offers a unique
opportunity to portray all the aspects of the lifestyle of
this early African pastoral culture.

The means of survival consisted of raising livestock
(goats and sheep), supplemented by hunting, fishing, Fig. 6. Kadruka, Tomb 106 (photograph: Kadruka, SFDAS)
and the gathering of edible plants. Whether
domesticated grains were cultivated, or whether only
wild millet was collected, is not clear.

The cemetery of Kadero provides valuable insights
into the population structure of a Neolithic settlement.
The 160 graves thus far excavated represent just a
fraction of a cemetery that must have contained several
hundred burials. Compared to other known early
Neolithic settlements, this one reflects a considerable
population growth. Especially striking, however, is the
differentiation between a small elite group with
ostentatious burial equipment and the rest of the
population. About ten percent of the Kadero graves—
burials of men, women, and children—belong to this
group, which perhaps bequeathed its rank as ruling
family from generation to generation (fig.6).

The burial pits of these well-equipped Kadero
tombs are dug exceptionally deep. The rich grave goods
include ivory jewelry, shells from the Red Sea, malachite,
stone tools, thin-walled pottery vessels, and weapons
such as stone maceheads. The red-polished or incised
pattern clay vessels from Kadero represent a first
technological and artistic highpoint in African ceramics.
Among the other technical innovations are composite
tools, consisting of microliths set in wood to serve as
knife and sickle blades. Malachite and Red Sea shells are
luxury goods that had to be brought from great

distances, thus attesting to contact far beyond the local
territory.

Near the town of el-Kadada in the region of
Shendi, about 180 kilometers down the Nile from
Khartoum, lies a late Neolithic site from the first half of
the fourth millennium .c. The position of the cemeteries
reveals charges in social structure, most likely resulting
from new economic conditions deriving from the drying
climate. Despite the differences in the finds from the
Khartoum Neolithic, one can nevertheless see in the
many similarities sufficient evidence for the continuity of
both cultural phases,

The settlement area spreads out over 3 mound of
several hectares; the occupation in some places is over a
meter thick- All the building foundations and cultural
deposits have been destroyed by subsequent activity on

southern foot of the mound is divided into various
cemeteries. In Cemetery A, about a hundred burials were
excavated and documented; of the three thousand
graves in Cemetery C, only two hundred have been
cleared so far. The typical Neolithic grave is a simple pit,
whose removed debris was later used to cover the burial
over again. This round or oval pit, measuring from 0.8 to
two meters in diameter, shows no evidence of
architectural features, but might originally have
possessed a superstructure of perishable materials. The
constricted burials (fig. 5) were placed upon a mat but
show no particular orientation or preference for the left
Or right side.

The equipment accompanying the corpse, like the
rest of the grave’s contents, provides us with references
to the contemporary living conditions. Whether these are
gender specific cannot be determined due to the dearth

--- Page 24 ---
REMARKS ON THE

of clearly identifiable male or female skeletons. The
grave goods allow a classification of the entire range of
finds from the settlement context, but on occasion also
contain unique objects. A standard system of burial
provisions cannot be established. Stone and bone
implements are placed in the hand of the deceased; ox
horns lie beneath his or her head. All other goods are
placed around the body. The significance of this
equipment is still debated, but few would disagree that
social differentiation was represented by the variety of
equipment. We can conclude from an overview of the
burial equipment and the orientation of the graves that
an individual's position within the community is reflected
in the position of his or her grave within the structure of
the cemetery.

In comparison to the older site of Kadero,
Cemetery C at el-Kadada shows an entirely different
division. Rich and poor tombs no longer appear in
separate sections of the cemetery area. A new grave type
shows two or three burials placed one above the other,
but carefully avoiding any damage to the lowest body.
This unusual break in tradition might suggest that
human sacrifice was practiced with more important
individuals (fig. 7). The hierarchical division of society,
which began with the Khartoum Neolithic, has now in
the fourth millennium become quite conspicuous.

The somewhat later Cemetery A clearly displays
this societal change, which is sometimes called the
“Neolithic Revolution.” An unusually large number of
graves occur loosely packed together and within a very
short period. The overlap of the individual graves must
have been intentional, revealing that a single burial could
be surrounded by a dozen additional burials that cut into
and partially destroyed it. These are most likely examples
of family tombs. What is unusual is the total absence of
child burials. However, on top of the mound within the
settlement area, burials of young children were found in
large, partially destroyed ceramic vessels just below the
surface. We must therefore assume that children
younger than about six years old (the age of an initiation
rite?) were not yet considered full-fledged members of
the community, and were therefore buried outside the
cemetery, within the settlement or in its vicinity.

Between the end of the Neolithic and the
beginning of the historical period is a gap in the
archaeological record for the central Sudan. This is

PREHISTORY

probably due to the shift to nomadic pastoral agriculture,
which leaves little in the way of archaeological remains.
The family structure as the foundation of this lifestyle has
its roots in the final phase of the culture of el-Kadada.

Nubia: Kadruka and Wadi el-Khowi

Around the middle of the fifth millennium s.c.,
three Neolithic groups that practiced a predatory
economy can be identified at the Second Cataract in
Lower Nubia. Two of these seem to be of indigenous
origin, while the third probably migrated and displays
similarities to the Early Khartoum (dotted wavy line
ceramics). The local Abka culture can be traced over an
entire millennium, developing in the middle of the fourth
millennium 8.c. into the A-Group culture. It is most
unusual that despite the great Nubian archaeological
salvage campaigns of the 1960s, the Neolithic in this
region still remains unattested by either settlements or
cemeteries.

It is only above the Third Cataract, thanks to the
excavations of the past two decades, that we can see a
completely different development. By the second half of
the fifth millennium s.c. at the latest, all the fundamental
elements of Neolithic culture—the domestication of
plants and animals, the production of ceramics, and the
technique of polishing stone implements—are in
evidence. Ongoing excavations currently focus on an
area of about fifty kilometers in the Wadi el-Khowi in the
Kadruka district. In the very fertile floodplain on the east
bank of the Nile, several ancient Nile branches are still
detectable. The archaeological sites lie spread out along
these old riverbeds, and can thus be gathered into a sort
of topo-chronology. At the easternmost point of the old
riverbeds the occupation began as early as the Mesolithic
and grew in the Neolithic, thanks to the productive
agricultural soil. With the shifting of the river course to
the west, this area was abandoned; only recently has it
again become agriculturally productive, this time
through the installation of motor pumps. Unfortunately,
this development represents a tremendous threat to the
area, which can be viewed as a vast archaeological park.
At a distance of less than a kilometer from the river lies
a concentration of settlement and burial sites in the now
flat region. The few mounds left are either recent sand
drifts or the remains of old Nile islands. Very strong wind
erosion has leveled the once much higher mounds,

depositing thick sand layers between them. More than
half a meter of the original Neolithic horizon has been
destroyed; instead of contextually related structures, only
strewn remains are left. Any interpretation of the
surviving remains is therefore poorly substantiated.

The cemeteries, on the other hand, offer a
completely different picture. They lie upon mounds, and
the depth of the burial shafts has saved the tombs from
destruction. Archaeologists today have a choice of more

14

than thirty necropoli, which offer a spectacular corpus
for research. They allow us to reconstruct the
development of burial customs from the sixth to the
fourth millennium s.c. Three or four of these necropoli
possess over a thousand burials each; an average
cemetery contains one hundred and fifty. The first group
is attested over a long period; since it unites various local
grave types within its well-defined stratigraphy, it can
serve as the control for testing a chronological

--- Page 26 ---
REMARKS ON THE PREHISTORY

framework. The cemeteries of the second group are
homogenous, reflecting only a short occupation phase.
They are typical of small, closed population groups. This
is important, since for illiterate societies the mortuary
cult is one of the few forms of expression of social
stratification. Cemetery no. 1 at Kadruka provides us
with a typical example (fig. 8).

Two groups of tombs are differentiated through
their position. The grave group at the highest point of
the mound develops concentrically around a centrally
placed, particularly deep grave (no. 131). Burials in this
tomb show the rich assortment of goods typical of
higher social classes. On the slope are graves with a
larger number of female burials. The burial equipment of
the forty-year-old inhabitant of Tomb 131 is by far the
most elaborate of the period. He was doubtless the most
important individual of this community of agriculturists
and pastoralists.

Thus as early as the fifth millennium 8.c. we find
chieftains at the apex of tribal communities, an
extraordinary observation for this early period. That this
development occurs in precisely this area is certainly no
accident; in the third millennium s.c. the very first African
kingdom, the kingdom of Kerma, will arise here.

Conclusion

The Neolithic sites described above are exemplary
of the latest developments in prehistoric studies in the
Sudan. Several teams have begun in recent years to form
links with international archaeological research. Step by
step, the characteristic features are emerging for an early
civilization whose huge occupation area and
geographical situation indicate a variety of influences
and cross-references. The chronology is also slowly
coming into focus, and the early age of the earliest
Sudanese cultures lends them their particular
significance for the rise of the subsequent high
civilization in Egypt.

After several hundred thousand years without
recognizable civilizational evolution, the Neolithic
introduces fundamental and lasting changes. From the
burial customs we can determine differentiated social
structures, which in turn rapidly evolve and lead to
localized special systems. The independent cultural forms
in Nubia and the Sudan provide examples for the
evolution of independent cultures in general. Although
lacking a writing system, they are a decisive factor in the
historical development of the millennia to follow.

Discovered in the tomb of an impor-
tant individual, this sandstone figurine
is representative of the creativity and
autonomy of Sudanese Nile Valley cul-
ture from its earliest beginnings. The
abstractly rounded female form takes
on an almost mummified appearance,
enhanced by the clever use of the
grain of the sandstone. The extreme
reduction of the shape to its character-
istic silhouette is interrupted only at
the head by four horizontal lines at dif-
ferent levels, connected by very faint
vertical lines, thus forming rectangular
eyes and giving the figure its direc-
tional orientation. An incised line over
the eyes might indicate the hairline.

PREHISTORY

OF THE SUDAN

The Kadruka example differs from al
other female figurines from the prehis-
tory of the Nile Valley (cf. cats. 2-4, 31)
and later eras (for example, cats.
41-46) in its avoidance of fulsome
thighs and any plastic treatment of the
breasts. In contrast to these typical
forms of prehistoric female idols, it Is
distinguished by the linear strength of
its composition and very compact body
masses, giving it a distinctive monu-
mentality. Scholars of modern art will

see the analogy to the sculptures of
Brancusi.

This figurine surpasses its predecessors
in cats. 2 and 3 in the treatment of the
body. The arms are once again abbre-
viated stumps, but this time the lower
body is not merely a simple rounded
form but an anatomically precise sepa-
ration of stomach and upper thighs. In
profile, it is clear that the figure repre-
sents a pregnant woman. The lines
carved at hip level are distinct from the
tattoos all over the rest of the body.
Like the neck lines of cats. 2 and 3,
these probably represent folds of skin,
another indication of a pregnant
female. Between the shoulders, finely
incised lines indicate that the missing
head once wore a pigtail.

The stylistic quality of the numerous
heads from ba statues varies consider-
ably, but they all share a direct, frontal
gaze and a formal symmetry of struc-
ture. Many of them show a deeply
incised horizontal line on the brow
below the hairline. This is to be under-
stood either as a scarification or, if the
figure wears a wig, as the actual hair
lying underneath. A depression is visi-
ble on top of the skull for the mount-
ing of a sun-disk.

Khartoum, National Museum 13365

In contrast to the large number of

heads from ba statues, this head from

the Spanish excavations at Argin forms

€n independent piece of sculpture. Its

large size is unusual, and the quality of

its workmanship exceeds that of all the

Other heads. It has no parallel in all of

Meroitic art, but shows instead a strik-

ing similarity to works created in the

Centuries surrounding the beginning of

the Christian era in the region of pre-
Sent-day Nigeria. In both the overall
facial expression and the individual
treatment of the eyes, nose, and
Mouth, the analogy is in fact so close
that a direct connection is difficult to
refute. The geographical distance
between the two regions, situated on
the same latitude on the east and west
Of the African continent, is about
2,500 kilometers. Studies of the migra-
tion patterns of central Africa are still
too sketchy to discern the route or
directional flow of this contact.
Nonetheless, the stylistic isolation of
the sandstone head from Argin, sur-
rounded there by a completely differ-
Ent artistic environment, suggests that
its inspiration—or its artist?—came
from West Africa.

A thickset hairstyle surrounds the
Spherical skull, divided into rectangular
locks above and diamond-shaped locks
at the temples and back. It extends to
just above the ears, represented by
Simple, unmodeled protrusions. A hor-
izontal line below the hair is deeply

THE KINGDOM OF

incised across the very high brow, just
below this runs a parallel but barely vis-
ible second line. The dominant facial
feature is the upper edge of the eye
sockets, indicated by deeply hollowed,
horizontal slits. Arching eyebrows are
incised just above, and the bags under
the eyes are likewise outlined by thin,
curving lines. Beneath the narrow
wedge of a nose, the small mouth is
indicated by a horizontal groove with
puffy lips. The entire effect is marked
by a restrained, linear strength in com-
plete contrast to the rounded form of
the unmodeled head and the
smoothed column forming the neck.

The head was most likely never part of
a complete statue, as is evident from
the large size and the smoothed, fin-
ished treatment of the base of the
neck, a feature found occasionally on
other Meroitic heads. Typologically, the
piece relates to portrait heads created
during the Old Kingdom in Egypt—
two and half millennia earlier—known
as “reserve heads.” But there is NO
context for associating any functional

similarity between the two types of
sculpture.

the deep undercutting of the eye-

The archaeological provenance of this
unique statue helps but little in dis-
cerning its date. It was discovered in a
secondary context near the enclosure
wall of the Eighteenth-Dynasty temple
at Buhen, together with a number of
objects from various periods. The head
and body are reduced to mere boxes
connected by a cylindrical neck. The
facial features are roughly incised, the
breasts are indicated by button-like
protrusions. The entire figure was
painted bright red. A broad collar with
a dotted pattern is visible, and a multi-
tiered black and red painted necklace
hangs around the neck. The hair at the
top and back of the head consists of a
pattern of black dots. The figure has
no parallels in Meroitic art, but a few
elements are reminiscent of sculptures
from South Arabia.

Imost all the royal tombs in the necropoli of Kurru,

Gebel Barkal, and Meroe were thoroughly plun-
dered. Those few objects that have survived—forgotten,
lost, or thrown aside by the tomb robbers—provide a
dull reflection of the original splendor of the tomb fur-
nishings. One exception, however, is Pyramid N 6 of the
kandake (ruling queen) Amanishakheto in the northern
cemetery of Meroe. Like many other pyramids there, it
was still well-preserved at the beginning of the nine-
teenth century, as is shown by Frédéric Cailliaud’s draw-
ing of 1822 (cf. fig. 45). Only twelve years later, it had
become a mere pile of stones. The Italian physician
Giuseppe Ferlini, who had come to the Sudan with
Muhammad Ali's troops, leveled it, as well as many
other pyramids, in the search for treasure. But by
employing this “method,” he was spectacularly success-
ful. An apparently undisturbed golden treasure came to
light, which Ferlini immediately hustled out of the coun-
try. In a catalogue published in Italian in Bologna in
1837, followed by a French edition published in Rome in
1838, he introduced his treasure to the world and
invited buyers.

In 1839 a portion of the finds was acquired by the
royal Bavarian art collections; the remaining portion
proved difficult to sell, probably because of the unusual
style of the jewelry, which cast doubt on the authentici-
ty of the find. This doubt was only removed a decade
after Ferlini’s discovery, when Richard Lepsius, who in
1842 had recommended acquisition for the Berlin
Egyptian Museum, arrived at Meroe. He reports in his
correspondence: “Several pyramids have been complete-
ly destroyed, others only partially. None had its top pre-
served. Our kavass, who was here with Ferlini, showed
us the spot beneath a now leveled pyramid where he
supposedly found his golden treasure.” Lepsius contin-
ues: “Osman Bey (who camped with his troops in the
vicinity) wanted to make treasure hunters out of his pio-
neers, and ordered his battalions here in order to rip a
number of pyramids apart. Ferlini’s discovery sticks in

The head of Athena is carved from four
layers of different colored agate. The
Attic helm shows a chariot with two
galloping horses and the goddess Nike
in the cart. A Gorgon’s head adorns
the breast. The cameo is doubtless an
import from the Mediterranean region.

The decoration of this shield-ring from
Faras, functionally similar to the rings
of Amanishakheto, takes the form of a
miniature stela. A winged sun-disk and
wedjat eyes flanking a central sa sign

Beneath the band of spheres on the
neck, three standing figures face left,
filling the entire height of the vessel
body. They follow the cubist principle
of Egyptian art in combining profile
and frontal perspective. The individual
style of the drawings, distinguished by
thin arms, frail legs, emphasis on the
hindquarters, and oversized eyes,
ascribes the vessel to the “prisoner
painter,” one of the individual artists
whose hand stands out unmistakably
from among the masses of anonymous
Meroitic vase painters. Many of his fig-
ures show.bonds drawn on the hands.
The painted double line running across
the necks of the figures here may also
represent binding ropes.

two life (ankh) signs and in turn by
four-petaled blossoms. The motifs
resemble high, narrow bridges against

are drilled through in several areas to
let water flow out of the basin. By
coming in contact with the ankh signs,
the water was magically purified.

The basin comes from the inner room
of the Lion Temple at Naga, near the
base of the god's shrine, and was used
for the cult of the lion-god Apedemak.

This fragment from the vicinity of the

explained by an additional tile from the

Hardly any find from the vicinity of the
Capital of Meroe has been so variously
interpreted as this extraordinarily well-
preserved silver goblet, found in the
ruins of Pyramid Beg. N 2 in the north-
ern cemetery. The four-figured relief
decoration shows a Roman emperor
with the features of Augustus, clad in
@ toga and enthroned on a sella
curulis. A man in a sleeveless tunic
approaches him with a lively step,
holding in his left hand an ax with a
long handle. A woman turns to both
of these figures with an appealing ges-
ture, her arms upraised; two small chil-
dren cling to her robe. Behind the
woman, the decoration concludes with
a striding man, dressed in a tunic and
hooded coat. The scene apparently
depicts the announcement of a judicial
decision. Interpreted historically, it
might show Augustus as new pharaoh
of Egypt declaring peace with the
country, personified by the woman. As
a mythological interpretation the leg-
end of Bocchoris comes to mind, and
even the theme of King Solomon as
lawgiver has been suggested.

Since the goblet shows absolutely no
Stylistic or iconographic affinity with
the Near East, Egypt, or Meroe, it is
fruitless to seek its explanation in these
regions. What is noteworthy is the sug-
gestion that the scene reproduces an
episode from a Greek tragedy.
According to Burkhalter and Arce, the
Scene represented is the judgment of

Although the modeling of the two
faces differs, these two bronze heads
doubtless form a pair. They were cast
by means of the lost wax method in
two pieces, soldered together at the
area of the diadem. This technique
provided for the easy application of the
eye inlays from the inside out. The gap
at the neck fitting, appearing right-
angled in profile view, allowed for the
attachment of the heads to statues
whose height can be reconstructed to
about seventy-five centimeters. Several
elements clearly identify them as repre-
sentations of the Greek god Dionysos:
the locks of hair gathered in braids the
floral diadem over the brow, the head-
band (of red copper with silver inlays)
and the full, youthful facial features,
According to C. Vermeule, the siete
type may be traced to the work of
Praxiteles. Owing to the existence of
two such heads, it is doubtful that they
were intended to stand alone as sepa-
rate statues. More likely they stood
together in a functional context that
required a statue pair. They probably
served as lamp stands, part of the valu-
able, imported luxury goods decorat-
ing the royal palace.

Post-Meroitic, fourth to fifth century A.
Khartoum, National Museum 26291

For the continuity of the Meroitic king-
dom in the fourth and fifth century
A.D., the most important site is el-
Hobagi, situated not far from Wad Ban
Naga on the left (west) bank of the
Nile. Instead of the pyramid form, the
traditional tumulus reappears, now
surrounded by a large temenos wall.
Although these are usually seen as typ-
ically post-Meroitic complexes, the
burial equipment found in the el-
Hobagi tombs indicates just the oppo-
site. Their inventory is strictly Meroitic;
hence the fall of the city of Meroe and
its royal cemetery is not delineated by
any sharp, historical break. The conti-
nuity of Meroitic culture extends into 453
the fourth and fifth centuries A.D.

An inscription in Meroitic hieroglyphs

mentioning the words “king” and 5 LO VinuDisav? Vashi

""god"" appears on this bronze bowl rr er ar re
from Tumulus Ill. This is the latest ‘ % ; BS A, A ade

known Meroitic text discovered so far. —4sq *. -

The bell-shaped vessels from el-
Kadada show definite Stylistic develop-
ments over their counterparts from
Kadero (cat. 5). The body has become
thinner, the mouth broader. The com-

pact, stocky form of the earlier Kadero
cups is replaced by an elegant, soaring
outline. The striped dot pattern, pro-
duced by impressing a comb-like
implement, covers the upper and
lower thirds of the exterior, leaving free
a smoothly polished central area. A tri-
angular pattern adorns the interior of
the rim. All the decoration is filled with

he great political, religious, and architectural

changes that swept Egypt following the conquest of
Alexander the Great and subsequent Roman rule did not
fail to affect her neighbor to the south as well. These
external influences contributed to the already existing
geographical, geological, climatic, and cultural factors
significant for construction techniques in the Sudan. The
synthesis of the indigenous and the foreign has resulted
in the individuality of Meroitic architecture and legit-
imized the stylistic term “Meroitic.” Tradition and exter-
nal influence, local and alien elements were all combined
in both practical/utilitarian and artistic/creative endeavors
to determine the function, construction, and form of
buildings. Since architecture is not a product for an
unknown market, but depends rather on local private or
societal order, we can value the art of building in the
kingdom of Meroe as a visible expression of the lifestyles
and social surroundings of the inhabitants—even if it
was destined only for a limited segment of society.

Secular architecture

Recent population estimates for the region of the
kingdom of Kush in its heyday suggest about five hun-
dred thousand inhabitants. These individuals, adminis-
tered more or less from Meroe, consisted mostly of
dwellers along the two banks of the Nile engaged in
agricultural activities. For large segments of the popula-
tion simple reed huts or shelters in the fields dressed with
matting’ were the only available protection against the
elements. In addition to these there were more massive
dwellings of unbaked brick, rectangular in plan, that
offered, along with a certain degree of comfort in the
form of two or three rooms, more durable protection.

For the more elite classes there were even larger
house complexes in which we can recognize distinct liv-
ing, reception, and economic areas, with a court in front.
In these complexes, a mixture of various construction

MEROITIC ARCHITECTURE

techniques is in evidence, for example, mud brick along
with stone slabs and rubble or combined with one- or
two-sided brick facing. Settlements at centers of trade or
administration developed along the lines of town plan-
ning. During the late Meroitic Period in Lower Nubia, the
settlement of Karanog, with its estimated surface area of
six to eight hectares (sixty to eighty thousand square
meters), probably a provincial capital and containing
some three to four thousand residents, is particularly
noteworthy. But an accurate picture of the street plans
and inner city layout cannot be gleaned from the town
plan of the original excavators. The structure of the set-
tlement seems distinguished by narrow, irregular, wind-
ing streets between two- and three-story houses with
mud-brick walls and partially vaulted roofs.2 Three-story
houses for an elite (governor?), encompassing a floor
area of about 650 square meters each, are designated as
palaces or “castles.”

In Upper Nubia, there is evidence of larger settle-
ments during the Meroitic Period worthy of the term
“town.” Among these are Kawa, with an area of seven-
teen hectares and about seven to eight thousand inhab-
itants, and the capital, Meroe, with about fifty hectares
within its purview, containing the royal city, temples,
workshops, streets, and squares. At its height, perhaps
about twenty to twenty-five thousand residents lived
here (fig. 47).3 However, the information gained from
excavations of 1910-144 is meager and provides no sat-
isfactory understanding of the residential and palace
architecture,

A better example is provided by the ruins located
further south at Wad Ban Naga, a town with several
temples and the residence of Queen Amanishakheto
(about 10 8.c.-0; fig. 48). The remains of the ancient set-
tlement (1000) are assumed to lie under the fields to the
east of the present-day railroad line. On its east side, two
long hills of broken brick and worked stone chips

delineate the position of the “Typhonium” (200) and the
Isis temple (300). A few meters away lie the ruins of the
queen's palace (fig. 49). The square building structure
(100), with its sixty-one-meter-long sides, covers about
3,700 square meters, and is thus one of the largest
Meroitic secular structures. Only the ground floor, con-
sisting primarily of mud-brick walls with sixty rooms,
entrance halls, inner ramps, and long magazines often
sealed from above, has survived the millennia under a
mound of debris.5 In the center of the upper floor lay an
open court—known from other buildings to take the

form of an atrium—around which the additional rooms
were grouped. The columns and capitals of the upper
peristyle had collapsed and were found fallen on the
ground floor.

On the eastern side of the upper floor, with its
reception areas and living quarters, one passed over a
twenty-one-meter-long ramp leading into the atrium,
similar to the identically sized Palace 1500 at Gebel
Barkal. Ramps in the interior linked the entrance halls in
the south and west with the upper floor. The western
gate opened onto an enclosed court chamber which

apparently linked the residence to the two temples. At
the east lay a small temple (400) at some distance in
front of the palace and, a hundred and fifty meters fur-
ther away, the Amun Temple (500).

We should certainly include the so-called royal
bath at Meroe (95, 194, 195) among the corpus of sec-
ular buildings. But the surviving elements of this struc-
ture, which betray a certain Ptolemaic-Roman influence
from the north, defy a realistic architectural analysis.

Military constructions form their own architectural
class, as can be seen in the two fortified sites of Hosh el-
Kab and Gebel Marrahi, with four-cornered bastions and
a ground plan of three double-rectangles in a proportion
of 8:5 (el-Kab) or a square (Gebel Marrahi). To this group
also belong the forts of Kubinat and el-Fura, as well as
the partially structured town wall of Meroe or that of
Dangeil. The city wall of Meroe, over a thousand meters
in length, ranged between 3.55 and 4.15 meters thick,
and may have stood that high as well.

The great Meroitic waterworks belong more
under the heading of engineering structures rather than

396

architecture. Nevertheless, mention must be made here
of the more than eight hundred hafirs (fig. 50). The
largest of these water catch-basins, dating to the third
and second centuries 8.c., have an average distance from
crest to crest of up to 250 meters (Awlib, Basa,
Musawwarat 51, Umm Usuda), and the Hafir Meroe 256
reached 183 meters (fig. 60; cf. also fig. 62 for MUS 51).
Large frog sculptures once ritually attracted the waters,
while lion figures took on apotropaic functions. Recent
investigations have sought to explain the hafir construc
tions in terms of economic factors and political expan-
sion of the Meroitic hinterlands, rather than the
influence of climatic fluctuations.”

Religious architecture

|. Temples

In the Sudan, the political changes in Egypt at the
beginning of the third century 8.c. are reflected especial-
ly strongly in the area of religious architecture. If we look
at the building activity in the Sudanese Nubian Nile Valley
in the preceding eras, we notice that the large temples

to the gods® and other significant works? either date to
the Twenty-fifth Dynasty or—as in the case of the Amun
Temple at Gebel Barkal (500)—achieved their final form
at that time. By contrast, the activities in the following
three hundred and fifty years, aside from the even more
ambitious mortuary complexes at Nuri, were much more
modest. Between 650 and 300 s.c. we find a dearth of
construction on new temple buildings. Perhaps the
emphasis at this time lay on alterations and completions
of already existing monuments, rather than on new
structures.'° This situation may have resulted from the
need for repairs following the destruction caused by the
expedition of Psametek Il (595-589 B.c.), from the need-
ed maintenance work on temples threatened with dete-
rioration over the preceding two to four centuries, or
from the relocation of the royal court to Meroe.
Whatever the cause, the moving of the capital improved
the conditions for the construction of temples to the
indigenous deities. From this point onward, the temples
for Egyptian gods had to share the building resources
with temples for Meroitic deities. The focal point of

397

construction activity shifted southward to Meroe and the
surrounding region.

Temples for Egyptian Gods

The axial orientation of the Amun temples, with
court and hypostyle as festival rooms, followed by
pronaos, barque room, and cult statue chamber as divine
apartments, is retained.'' The incompletely excavated
Amun Temple at Meroe (MER 260; fig. 51) provides an
example of such a ground plan (fig. 52). It appears to
have been built in two separate phases, with the west-
ern half arising in conjunction with or soon after the con-
struction of the wall of the royal city (or a predecessor
wall thereof).'2 In the first building phase there followed
behind a pylon a court roofed on both sides (270), a hall
of appearances (273), a pronaos (269), and a barque
room (261), ending finally with the cult statue chamber.
The rooms to the north and south—except for the
throne hall (266)—were probably magazines and side
chambers, The measurements taken for some of the
rooms reveal clear, harmonic proportions. The area of the

Cidcsied : eroe. Moreover, the other Meroitic temples
© Amun are also smaller, measuring at Naga

398

(100), for example, about seventy cubits for the actual
temple building (fig. 54).

A second, smaller temple type was also devised
during the Meroitic Period. Its sanctuary area terminated
in three chambers, as shown in Temple 200 at Naga
(fig. 55). In front of these were two chambers, of which
the first, with two columns or, in special cases in some
temples, four (BAR 1300, BAR 1400) or even eight (WAD
BAN NAGA 500), is reminiscent of the hypostyle hall.
The second chamber, corresponding to the pronaos, was
smaller and contained either no columns or just two
(BAR 1300, BAR 1400). Noteworthy are the interrelated
proportions in relations of 1:1 and 8:5, which produce 4
linear extension in a proportional tripartition. The temple
of Naga dates to late Meroitic times and thus displays
exterior proportions typical of Meroitic temple architec-
ture, instead of the harmonic interior proportions
favored in Egyptian temples. 14

Likewise, the structures BAR 700-sec, NAGA 500,
and MER 720 are all Meroitic Period monuments dedi-
cated to the god Amun. Also built for Egyptian gods
were the so-called Typhonium and the temples dedicat-
ed to the goddess Isis (300) in Wad Ban Naga, and addi-
tional temples to the same goddess in Musawwarat
(800) and Meroe (600 a, b).

For all these monuments we can conclude that
the chamber measurements followed symmetrical, har-
monic interior proportions. Furthermore, our investiga-
tions so far indicate that temples for Egyptian gods,
unlike their counterparts built for indigenous deities,
were constructed using the Egyptian cubit as measuring
unit.

Temples for native gods

In contrast to temples for the gods of Egypt,
which consist of a long series of chambers strung
together, temples dedicated to Meroitic deities con-
tained only one or two chambers, with or without a
pylon. The earliest independent forms for a Meroitic type
of one-roomed temple may derive from the carefully pro-
portioned chapels in front of the tumuli at Kerma,'® the
buildings Barkal 700.sub.1 and sub.2, and Barkal 900.

To this building type belong, for example, the
temples at Musawwarat (300, 1000), Naga (300, 500,
700), Tabo (300), Wad Ban Naga (400), Matruka, and
Murabba, as well as the temples with subsequently

added peripteral rows of columns'é in Tabo (200), Naga
(400, 800), Basa (100), and Gebel Hardan.

Many of these temples are associated with the
worship of the lion-god Apedemak. A few with pre-
served inscriptions and reliefs dedicated to this god serve
to distinguish other buildings of similar type. An example
of a lion temple, besides the one in Musawwarat
(1000),'7 is the recently explored temple 300 at Naga
(fig. 56). This monument!8 rests on a plinth and is ori-
ented to the southeast. A richly decorated Vitruvian por-
tal'9 and chamber gate in a 6.5-meter-high pylon leads
to a single room whose roof is supported by wooden
girders resting on four columns. Sandstone from a near-
by quarry provided the material for all load-bearing and
room-defining elements. The two pairs of columns divide
the room unequally, allowing for a larger area in the rear
section for a wooden shrine whose carefully worked sup-
port of carved stone has survived. Both exterior and inte-
rior wall surfaces of the temple bear reliefs which were
originally finished with lime plaster,2° pigments, metal,

399

and stone inlays. The exterior walls terminated in cavet-
to cornices. The exterior pylon and building corners taper
to the wall surfaces at eighty-six or eighty-seven degrees,
forming sharply angled borders and, together with the
frieze of stars, mirroring frames that encompassed the
reliefs.

Special care was taken with the measuring and
laying out of the monument. The basic unit of measure-
ment was the module (M), derived from Greek architec-
ture, rather than the cubit used for the temples
dedicated to Egyptian gods. The module used for the
Lion Temple as the lower diameter of the columns mea-
sures about 65 centimeters. The pylon thus covered an
area of 16 M x 2 M. Its width and height bore the har-
monic proportion of 8:5 (fig. 57). The length of 16 M
was also used for the exterior measurement of the mon-
ument behind the pylon. This resulted in an overall pro-
portional figure of 1:1. The width of the structure
developed out of two harmonious 8:5 rectangles and
bore 13 M. The interior room displayed with its

A rchaeological interest in Nubia began as early as
the start of the century, when the American
Egyptologist George A. Reisner carried out digs along
the Nile upstream from Aswan, pinpointing and record-
ing the sites threatened by raising the height of the dam.
This research was begun at the request of Gaston
Maspero, director general of the Egyptian Antiquities
Service at the time. Reisner drew up a first classification
of Nubian cultures, which he categorized using letters of
the alphabet; these have been retained for Groups A, C,
and X.1

The A-Group culture, which has its origins in the
rich Neolithic tradition of Nubia and probably in the
Egyptian Nagada culture as well, created considerable
interest among researchers during the international cam-
Paign to safeguard the sites and monuments of Nubia
(1960-69).2 On the one hand, it appears to have been
Organized in small chieftaincies or principalities from the
middle of the fourth millennium e.c., at a crucial point in

the formation of the Egyptian state. On the other hand,
it probably served as an intermediary between Egypt and
the regions further south, and was perhaps involved in
mining resources in the eastern desert. Three chronolog-
ical phases have been distinguished: the ancient phase (c.
3700-3250 B.c.), the classical phase (c. 3250-3150 8.c.),
and the final phase (c. 3150-2800 8.c.).

Although the research and excavations carried out
in the Nubian campaign have allowed us to piece
together the major lines of the population of Lower
Nubia during the A-Horizon, the same cannot yet be said
for the territory between the Second and Fourth
cataracts.4 More recent research carried out at Kermaé
and Kadruka,§ upstream from the Third Cataract, indi-
cates that there were people there around 3000 s.c. In
the present state of research, we prefer to call them pre-
Kerma: the geographical location is very different end
the ceramic style, although related to that of A-Group, is

not exactly comparable; in addition, Egyptian imports are
Practically nonexistent.

This pre-Kerma Culture could also partly fill the

PREHISTORY OF THE SUDAN

Fig. 10. A-Group tomb types (after W. Adams)

Several superimposed burials in a single pit could,
as in Neolithic times, mean human sacrifices, but this
hypothesis remains to be confirmed. The organization of
the cemeteries, the shape of the tombs, and the kinds of
materials found therein suggest that there was a certain
hierarchy in the society. A few prestigious items stand
out, which could only have been the prerogative of
chiefs, such as the maces from Sayala with the handle
covered in gold and decorated with animals,” or the
stone vase from Qustul, whose engraved decoration is
unusual because of its very special iconography.8 A-
Group settlements seem to have been small in size and
composed mainly of huts or other flimsy constructions. A
larger grouping has been uncovered at Afyeh, where the
houses were made from stones bound with alluvium and
had several rectangular rooms. This site probably corre-
sponds to a chieftaincy’s headquarters.2 At Khor Daud,
over five hundred silo-pits dug into the earth have been
uncovered. In them were storage vessels, most of which
came from Egypt.'9 It is likely that there was a settlement
here or in the immediate vicinity, as was the case at

Kerma.

On the latter site, in fact, the area where similar
silo-pits lay was surrounded by circular huts with a diam-
eter of 4.3 to 4.7 meters. Only one building was rectan-
gular in shape. There were many intercuttings in the
series of post-holes. An extremely rare find was also

made here: deep excavations have revealed a stratified
area with a hearth and material, which is being studied.
To date, a hundred and eighty pits have been recognized
as such, with several showing signs of rubefaction and
Only three still containing jars in situ.""!

The arm of the Nile where this settlement was
located probably dried up in the first half of the third mil-
lennium B.c., causing the site to be abandoned. A survey
carried out along the dead river branch has revealed
scatters of artifacts over several kilometers, signaling that
there must have been other similar settlements whose
structures have disappeared due to the combined effects
of wind erosion and washing of the soil. No very charac-
teristic pre-Kerma tomb has been discovered. A few buri-
als excavated at Kadruka probably also belong to this
pre-Kerma occupation. Little or no equipment was
found.

The Nubian pottery of A-Group, like pre-Kerma
work, stands apart fairly clearly from contemporary
Egyptian production,12 especially in the way the surface
is treated, often being perfectly polished and decorated
with a wide variety of geometric designs inspired by bas-
ketwork. Shapes are above all represented by basins,
bowls, cups, and neckless jars, all handmade. There are
a great number of red wares with black mouths and inte-
riors. Characteristic of A-Group production are wares
with a rippled outer surface (rippled ware), which are red
with black mouths, and pottery in a very fine light brown
Nile silt, covered with a geometric design painted in dark
red (eggshell or variegated hematitic ware).13 Pre-Kerma
pottery is being classified, which will of course facilitate
comparisons with A-Group production, but also with the
final Neolithic production of central Sudan'4 or with that
of the culture at Omdurman, near Khartoum.!5
