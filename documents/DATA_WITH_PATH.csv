They come from a spectacular crescent made up of 4,351 cattle skulls south of Grave 253, dated to the Kerma Moyen period (2050-1750 nc) (see fig. 54). Cattle skulls were carved in order to preserve only the frontal part and the horns. At the end of the Kerma Ancien period, the carving preserved the nasal bones, while later the skull was cut near the nasal spine, During the Kerma Clas- sique period bucrania were reduced to the highest part of the frontal and the two horns. The skin was removed as attested by numer- ous tracks of knives or razors (Chaix 1993). Sometimes bucrania were decorated with red patches (cat. 71b) or entirely painted with red ochre, The deposition of bucrania, always in the southern part of the tumuli, began at the end of the Kerma Ancien culture with an acme during the Kerma Moyen period, declining in the Kerma Classique. The number of bucrania is linked with the social importance of the deceased and the size of the grave. The composition of an assemblage does not reflect a living herd. The proportion of the various categories (bulls, cows, calves and oxen) differs from a natural cattle herd. The disposition of the bucrania follows precise rules: in the front a row of cows, often accompanied by young calves; behind, a row of bulls, followed by a row of oxen. This arrangement may be repeated many times as shown in Grave 253 where forty rows of skulls were discovered (Chaix 1996). In the graves of important persons there are bucrania with strong deformation of the horns that have been forced to grow parallel as illustrated by the bucranium shown here (cat. 71¢; Chaix 2001). The bucranium of the calf shows a bulb at the tip of the left horn (cat. 71d). This feature can be linked with a future deformation of the horns. The bucra- nia with parallel horns form many rows intermixed with the normal ones. This man-made deformation is similar to those currently practised in the southern Sudan (Murle) and in’ the Ethiopia (Turkana), Saharan prehistoric rock art also north of presents numerous cattle with horns pointing forward, The significance of such a deforma- tion remains unknown, LC Chaix 1993, 175-85; 1996, 95-7; 2001, 364-70 SUDAN: ANCIENT TREASURES a> re 4",31109,sudan-ancient-treasures-images/31109_31110_31111_31112_31113.png,False,sudan-ancient-treasures-images/31109_31110_31111_31112_31113.png

W 270 mm, Th } 17mm SNM 18 A round-topped stela, in good condition, missing only a section of the bottom left-hand corner. The body of the stela bears an incised hieroglyphic inscription, arranged in ten hor- izontal lines, the signs reading from right to left. The lunette is decorated, in sunk relief, With a religious motif in the form of the so- called shen-ring flanked by two udjat eyes. Both the motif and the inscription were fin- ished in green paint, substantial traces of which remain. The text reads: ‘(1) A gift that the king gives (to) Osiris, Lord of Busiris, the Great God, Lord of Abydos, (2) and (to) Horus, Lord of Foreign Land{s}, that they may give an invocation offering consisting of bread and beer, oxen and fowl, and all things (3) good and pure, on which a god lives, which heaven creates and (4) earth makes, which Hapy (the Nile Indundation) brings as his per- fect offering, for the spirit (5) of the nobleman Ka, It is the son of his daughter who makes his name to live, (6) namely the nobleman Tah-user. He (Ka) says: I was a valiant servant (7) of the ruler of Kush. I washed my feet (8) in the waters of Kush in the following of the (9) ruler Nedjeh. [ returned (10) safe and sound (and) my family (too).’ During the Middle Kingdom, the Egyptians invaded and occupied Lower Nubia (the land of Wawat), establishing a new southern border upstream of the Second Cataract. Buhen was one of a chain of great fortresses which they built along the Nile in Wawat to consolidate and extend their economic interests and to police the native population. The major aims were to control the rich goldmines of Nubia’s Eastern Desert and the trade in African goods with lands further to the south. Towards the end of the 13th Dynasty (1795-1650 BC), Egypt underwent a great political upheaval and, among other consequences, was obliged to withdraw from Nubia. In the north a Canaanite dynasty, known as the Hyksos, took control of the Nile Delta and Lower Egypt. In the south Wawat and the fortresses, among them Buhen, were occupied by the forces of the powerful kingdom of Kush, based at Kerma just south of the Third Cataract. It appears that not all Egyptian personnel chose to flee. Some remained to serve the new masters. This stela is one of a group of monuments from Buhen belonging to a single family who administered the fortress over several genera- tions during the period of Kushite rule. A high official named Ka was the owner of the stela, which was dedicated to him by his grandson, also a high official, named Iah-user. We know from other sources that Ka was preceded in office by his father and grandfather, both named Sobekemheb. His younger brother, named Sepedhor, served as ‘commandant of Buhen’ and was instrumental in rebuilding the Temple of Horus at Buhen where their stelae were set up. Both proudly state that they served the ruler of Kush whose name is given on the stela of Ka as Nedjeh. There is insuffi- cient data to decide on the precise dates of Ka and Sepedhor, and of the Kushite king in ques- tion, but the latter is perhaps to be identified as the owner of one or other of the two latest tumuli in the royal cemetery at Kerma, desig- nated as K.IV and K.III respectively, which are roughly contemporary with the mid- to late 17th Dynasty (1650-1550 be) in Egypt.

It is decorated in sunk relief, with @ --- Page 104 --- somewhat schematic figure of a king shown as if striding to the right. He wears the white crown of Upper Egypt with a uraeus at the forehead and a short skirt with a protruding front, probably a version of the royal shendyt- kilt. In his rear hand he holds a mace, and in his front hand a long, double-curved bow and three arrows. The body of the figure was painted red, his kilt and crown white. There are good grounds, both stylistic and archaeological, for identifying the figure as one of the kings of Kush, shown as having ‘adopted in part at least the regalia of Pharaoh, specifically as king of Upper Egypt’ (Smith 1976, 12). This was no empty aspira- tion on the part of the Kushites. During the Kerma Classique period they not only ruled the whole of Nubia but also carried out at least one substantial invasion of Upper Egypt (cat. 75). It has been suggested that the king repre- sented here may be the Nedjeh mentioned on the Buhen stela of Ka (cat. 73). wvD Berenguer 2003c; Morkot 2000, 68, fig. 32; Smith 1976, 11-12, no. 691, 84, 246, pls iii, 2, lviii, 4; Soulé-Nan 2002, 161-2, fig. 31; Wildung 1997, 100, no. 100; Williams 199 1b, 80, 83, fig. 8a",62,,False,

Inside the flask there are substantial remains of its original contents, initial analysis! identifying it as a now-degraded oil of plant origin. The flask bears, incised on the exterior body, a rectangular frame enclosing a funer- ary inscription arranged in three columns of hieroglyphs, reading from right to left and down, identifying its contents and original owner: A gift which [the king] gives, that he may give incense and unguent to the spirit of the Governor, Hereditary Prince, of Nekhen (Hierakonpolis), Sobeknakht.’ This flask is one of a substantial number of SUDAN: ANCIENT TREASURES Egyptian objects buried in the royal tumuli at Kerma, in this case in an elite subsidiary grave within the precincts of Tumulus K.II, the last of the great tumuli in the Eastern Cemetery. The original source of the flask would have been the Egyptian owner’s tomb presumably located at Hierakonpolis (though not impossi- bly perhaps at ElKab), from which it was proba- bly plundered during a Kushite raid on the region. There are several other objects origi- nally from Hierakonpolis among the Kerma material. That such raids took place is con- firmed by an inscription recently discovered (Davies 2003a, d and e) in the tomb of another Sobeknakht, a governor of ElKab, the twin- town of Hierakonpolis, during the 17th Dynasty, who may well have been related to his namesake across the river. It records the occur- rence of a major Kushite attack on Upper Egypt during his governorship, one of the main aims of which was to secure booty (the aggressors are referred to in the inscription as ‘looters’), much of it evidently destined for reuse and deposition at Kerma.

The piece is finely sculpted and in very good condition. Amenemhat is represented as wearing a long, broad, shoulder-length wig, a short beard and a tight-fitting cloak that envelops his body, except for the arms shown emerging just in front of the knees, the right crossed over the left, with the right hand clenched, the left extended palm-downwards. His face is broad and triangular in shape and his expres- sion benign. The eyes, asymmetrically posi- tioned, are large, wide-open and slope markedly inwards, the eyebrows and cos- metic lines rendered as raised bands. The nose is relatively narrow and pointed at the end. The mouth, with two thick lips, is small with just the hint of a smile. The ears, set high, are large and splay slightly against the wings of the headdress. The treatment over- all, and particularly of the eyes, is evocative of that of royal portraiture of the period. Incised between the knees and legs, on the front of the figure, is a hieroglyphic inscription arranged in four columns, reading from right to left and top to bottom: ‘Gift that the king gives (to) Horus, Lord of Buhen, that he may give invocation offerings consisting of bread, beer, oxen, fowl, alabaster, linen, incense, unguents, all things good and pure, offerings of every vegetable, that upon which a god lives, every- thing which comes forth upon his offering table regularly every day, for the spirit of the scribe Amenemhat, repeating life, possessor of veneration’. Further, single columns of inscrip- tion are located towards the rear of the figure, on the right and left sides respectively and on the rear itself. The side inscriptions repeat the owner's title and name and also identify his parents. The column on the figure’s right side reads (from right to left and down) ‘Scribe Amenemhat, begotten of the chief of Teh-khet Rwiw [mis-spelt as Rwsw]’, that on the left (from left to right and down) ‘Scribe Amen- emhat, born to the mistress of the house, Rwna’. The column on the rear reads ‘Revered [before] Osiris, Scribe Amen- emhat, justified’. In form and style, <is is a typical ‘block- statue’ of the early {2th Dynasty, a dating confirmed by the identity of the owner and his parents, who are known from other monu- ments of the period (cf. cat. 78). It was found buried as one of a cache of three statuettes, one of the others also belonging to the same Amenemhat (now Philadelphia E 10980). Originally placed in one of the temples of Horus at Buhen, they were probably removed and buried during the 18th Dynasty before the Amarna Period, as on both figures of Amen- emhat, the name element Amen’ has been left untouched, suggesting that the pieces were inaccessible to Akhenaton’s agents.

The surface of its back is well polished. Details of the insect's body are represented by incised lines. On the flat side a hieroglyphic text runs horizontally from right to left, giving the name and title of the deceased and the beginning of Chapter 30B of the Book of the Dead. This object was part of the funerary equipment of an undisturbed burial, found in a secondary subterranean room of the tomb. It was located on the breast, over the position of the heart. When mummification was per- formed, the heart was generally kept inside the body. However, very often a stone amulet was added, first shaped in the form of the ancient Egyptian’s conventional representa- tion of the heart in hieroglyphic writing, and from the 18th Dynasty, in the form of a large scarab, one of the forms of the god Ra, named Khepri. Several spells of the Book of the Dead, Chapters 26-9, were intended to prevent the heart of a man from being stolen after his death. In Chapter 30B, used here, the heart itself, regarded as a real being, is called out not to testify against its owner at the moment of the Judgement. SUDAN: ANCIENT TREASURES A very similar heart scarab, now in the Cairo Museum, was discovered about fifty years ago by Steindorff in a New Kingdom tomb at Aniba, the most important site in Lower Nubia at this period (Steindorff 1937, 14, 88, 240-41 and pl. 48).

The head, sculpted in the round, represents a face with heavy features, surrounded by a short wig. The mixed form of this funerary amulet — the simple scarab and the ba-bird with human head — is one of the multiple aspects taken by the so-called ‘heart scarab’. All of them served the same function, revealed by the presence of the text of Chapter 30B of the Book of the Dead on similar inscribed objects. The present item is uninscribed. It was found in a subsidiary room of the tomb, on the chest of an aged man whose funerary equipment included an inscribed shabti bearing his name, a little scarab with royal iconography (cat. 94) and a ring (cat. 88). Its position, higher than the associated bones, suggests that the amulet was placed above the coffin and not inside, as was usually the case. Such human-headed heart scarabs are rather uncommon. A few others have been discovered in the same necropolis of Sai. as well as in the New Kingdom cemetery of Aniba in Lower Nubia (Steindorff 1937. pl. 48, no. 18; pl. 49, nos 20, 21).

The head and elytreas are carved in low relief. On the flat side a traditional picture of royal iconography is carved: the massacre of enemies. The version represented here shows the king walking, wearing the khepresh- crown, his right hand holding a large mace above his head. With the other hand he grips a 91, bottom right; 92, bottom left; 93, top right; 94, top left bound prisoner whose hands are tied behind his back. Protruding above the king's fore- head, we can see the most common attribute of divine and royal figures, the rearing cobra — the uraeus — connected with the cobra- goddess Wadjyt. It was thought to exterminate all evil, represented here by the prisoner. A second uraeus is pictured in the space between the arm and the leg of the king. This scarab was discovered in the same undisturbed burial as the human-headed heart scarab (cat, 87) and the signet ring (cat. 88), It had probably been hung around the neck of the deceased in the coffin. SUDAN: ANCIENT TREASURES Other scarabs bearing the same pattern, with some variants in the details of represeng tation, have been found in certain cemeterie in Lower Nubia, such as Dakka (Firth 1915, pls 39, 41), el-Riqa (Emery and Kira, 1935, 201, fig. 199) or another cemetery between Dakka and Qurta (Firth 1915, pls 36, 147). It seems that the first appearance of this theme might be dated to Thutmose III, a king who greatly enlarged Egyptian territory during the 18th Dynasty. During the next dynasty, this motif was reused significantly by another conquering king, Ramesses II. FT 119 --- Page 121 --- 120 SUDAN?

It is part of the category of pottery figure vases in moulded terracotta studied by J. Bourriau (1987, 85) and dated to the 18th Dynasty (from the beginning until Thutmose Ill). The fabric is fine, covered with a burnished red slip with details represented in black pigment. The body is made in two moulded parts joined manually; the dorsal and caudal fins were then added. The collar is represented by the open mouth of the fish. The vase was empty, without traces of any content. This fish is the tilapia nilotica that is so often represented, notably with lotuses in cups of blue faience, It has its place in a funeral context because it is a symbol of revival (Dambach and Wallert 1966, 276, 283-94. Desroches-Noblecourt 1954, 33-42). Well-known parallels offer variations in details and quality (Bourriau 1987, 89-90). In the context of the eastern cemetery of Deir el-Medina from where vases of the same group come, it was recently proposed that they would have belonged to members of the middle class (Pierrat-Bonnefois 2003, 59). In Nubia, however, such a vase would most likely have been seen as a luxury item. AM-G",31319,sudan-ancient-treasures-images/31319.png,True,

It is also datable to the first half of the 18th Dynasty. The fabric is the same and it is cov- ered with the same red burnished slip, par- tially crackled. Its decoration is applied in black lines: the frieze of triangles on the lip, the horizontal line at the base of the collar, the sheets of palm stylized on the belly of the vessel, and the grids hung as nets on the han- dles. The shape of the vase was perhaps inspired by contemporary Cypriot vases, but it is incontestably Egyptian from Nubia, and illustrates that which J. ourriau (1987, 82-3) calls ‘a foreign fallacy’, in reference to the tendency of twentieth-century scholars to attribute to foreign (north and east) coun- tries all that was good and original in Egypt- ian pottery. This shape of amphora seems to appear during the reign of Hatshepsut aud lasts up to the Amarna period (Bourriau 1982b, 127). AM-G",31320,,False,

Kohl pots intended as containers or for the preparation of cosmetics could, like these, be made of Egyptian alabaster (calcite), but they could also be made from other stones, or wood, faience or ivory. They are frequently part of the equipment in Egyptian tombs (Vandier d'Abbadie 1972, 85-7). Kohl was used by both men and women to protect and outline the eyes. Black koh! was made from crushed galena and green kohl from malachite. Kohl, in a funerary context, was important because of — --- Page 122 --- 97a-d its use as make-up — notably, to the Eye of Horus which is referred to as early as the Pyra- mid Texts. The offering of make-up was equiva- lent to the offering of the Eye of Horus itself, and this was the symbol of resurrection (Troy 1991, 151). Moreover, kohl pots are often found close to the body of the deceased. The use of kohl pots becomes frequent in the Middle Kingdom. The three examples here are of a type that was current in the New Kingdom. These small vases are of a wide and squat shape and fit well within the hand. They have not retained any traces of contents, nor of any lid, and no pestle was found with them. The small cup doubtless served as a palette for the preparation of the make-up, although no residue of colour gives evidence of its use.

Another mask, in plaster, from SUDAN: ANCIENT TREASURES the same cemetery is also presented here (cat. 288). The mask is of beautiful work, and made from a well-fired fabric. The face is triangular and finely featured. The eyes are almond- shaped, with the outline incised and the interior in relief; the eyebrows are very long and extend towards the temples; the nose and the lips are in relief, with a sharp profile. The lower half of the face is damaged: the top of the nose, the lips and the chin are worn but the features are preserved as well as a sweet smile similar to that of a kore; the reverse is slightly concave. The mask was placed directly on the face of the deceased and fixed with linen or stucco which completely enveloped the body. Such masks were moulded, painted and often covered with a golden sheet (Troy 1991, 65). Masks in stucco or terracotta are well known in the Nubian New Kingdom cemeter- ies, notably in Sai, in the cemeteries exca- vated by the Scandinavian expedition near the Second Cataract (Troy 1991, 64), Buhen (Randall-Maclver and Woolley 1911, 142, pl. 61) and in Aniba (Steindorff 1937, 73-4). Steindorff speculates that their small size was governed by the need of the Egyptian officials to transport them. Their latest use, in both Egypt and Nubia, dates to the end of the 18th or beginning of the 19th Dynasty (Troy 1991, 65).

It became extremely popu- lar in Egypt where over time it developed a tapering body and pronounced shoulders (Hope 1989, 93). It is possible that it con- tained wine. This hypothesis is confirmed by the presence next to the amphora of the bronze point of a siphon which was used to filter the impurities from the wine. Such a use is well illustrated on a well-known stela from el-Amarna, showing a Syrian man drinking wine from a similar type of amphora.

It seems that the bowl was made in a place where the Egyptian writing was appreciated for its decorative value, but was not well known or commonly practised. The bow! was found about 100 mm below an in situ burial with two tall beakers of a type common in the 25th Dynasty (cat. 118) as offerings; it should therefore be considered slightly earlier in date.

Copper-alloy wire has been wrapped around the ring-shaped handle. The ring was inserted into a suspen- sion loop fixed by two rivets. The loop is asym- metrical and appears to have been repaired in the past. The outside of the bowl is decorated with an incised band just beneath the rim. A hieroglyphic inscription gives the name of the Egyptian officer for whom the bowl was made. The inscription is still under study, but the type of writing and the references to the Egyptian officer suggest a possible dating to the Ramesside period (19th Dynasty). The bowl was found upside down on the floor of the first room of Tomb 19, and thus belongs to the earliest phase of its use. However, it is earlier than the other objects found in the same layer, and therefore was possibly already old when it was placed in the tomb as a funerary offering.

The bowl was found on the floor of the inner chamber of Tomb 19, supposedly in the place where the deceased's head lay. The chamber had been severely looted and no other objects were found. This bowl was so shallow that it must have remained hidden from the robbers by a thick layer of mud. Remains of a linen cloth and fragments of a sycamore box were found together with the bowl. It is therefore possible that the bowl was placed in the tomb wrapped in a linen cloth and inside a box. As it was found on the floor of the room, it can therefore probably be dated to the Late New Kingdom or to the Third Intermediate Period. However, its rather common shape and lack of decoration leave some doubts as to a more precise dating.

The head was discovered by Griffith during the excavation of the Temple of Amun (Temple T) in the south-east corner of the First Court. Its facial features are consistent with the iconography of Tahargo (cf. fig. ¥8),! and it almost cer- tainly dates to his reign, 690-664 BC, as is highly likely in any event from the context. It is uncertain when the body of the statue was found: it was already in the Merowe Museum when the head was discovered. Ptah was the chief god of Memphis, the patron deity of artists, craftsmen and builders. By the time of the construction of the Temple of Amun at Kawa, Memphis had been the de facto capital of Kush for a quarter of a century. The Memphite god Ptah was especially venerated by the Kushites and he is frequently depicted within the Kawa temple where he appears to have had a popular cult (for the importance of Ptah at Kawa see Térdk 2002, 89 ff.).

The lower part of the impression is a mirror image of the upper. The decoration is enclosed by a narrow raised oval border.

The face is broad and is dominated by the short nose, with widely flared nostrils and small nostril open- ings. The mouth, as wide as the nose, has markedly protruding, almost pouting, thin lips which are not quite closed, revealing a row of rectangular teeth. The large almond- shaped eyes are not clearly differentiated from the cheeks along their lower edge but the upper lids are prominent. The eyebrows are represented by four grooves over the left eye and by three grooves over the right eye. The ears, which stick out at right angles from the head, are semi-circular with a deep semi- circular depression against the side of the head and two concentric grooves towards the edge of the earlobes. The outer groove is pierced by two circular holes. The pert breasts have prominent circular nipples with a depression in the centre, and there is a deep circ:::s: navel in the trim stomach. The pubic hair is indicated by short incised lines arranged in several horizontal rows, and with an oblique row delimiting the hair towards each thigh. A vertical groove indicates the vulva. The legs are bowed with no indication of knees and the feet are small and stubby. The arms are arranged symmet- rically with the hands resting on the sides of the legs adjacent to where the knees should be. Grasped in the poorly formed right hand and held against the lower arm is a straight- bladed dagger with a pronounced median rib. The neck of a snake is held in the left hand and the sinuous body tapering into the tail extends up the arm to the neck. The snake's head is held tight against the side of the leg. Crowning the head is a large flaring feather headdress of four plumes, the median rib and the tines indicated by shallow and narrow incised grooves. The sides of the headdress round into the top which, although damaged, appears to be slightly concave towards the centre. Nine holes survive close to the top edge of the headdress. At the base of the headdress a line of short vertical grooves presumably represents the hair, the same method used to depict the pubic hair. The whole of the front and sides of the figure is covered in whitewash, overlain in places by traces of paint in other colours. The poor preservation of the painted surface makes it difficult to reconstruct the original decoration. Fragments of yellow are visible particularly on the thighs, lower torso, shoul- ders, around the edge of the earlobes and at the base of the headdress above the left eye- brow. The pubic hair is picked out in black. The left shoulder has an area decorated by large black and white dots on the yellow back- ground. This may represent a leopard skin draped over the shoulder and from the lower edge of the yellow are rectangular stripes which may represent tassels. Similar stripes are visible hanging down on the lower left leg. Some of the grooves on the headdress are filled with red paint and part of the surface is yellow, The snake along the left arm is picked out in red and the upper two grooves of the left eyebrow are filled with red paint. The rear of the statue is flat and was clearly not meant to be seen, although it is also covered in white- wash. The base, which tapers from front to back, extended 100 mm beyond the back of the statue and had presumably been set into a wall, the statue standing flush against the wall face. This may explain the absence of a tail, --- Page 158 --- The .::.°22 exhibits many of the characteris- tics of i: setter known representations of Bes (cf. cats 166, 285), but whereas there is often some sexual ambiguity with Bes figures, the Kawa piece is unashamedly female. A number of gods are represented in the visual form usu- ally associated with Bes, among them Aha and Hayt (Romero 1989, 14). If a similar situation pertains to the female form the identification of the Kawa statuette with Beset may not be strictly correct. The existence of the female form has been doubted (ibid., 16-17), but the gender of the Kawa piece calls for a reconsider- ation of the evidence.! Representations of Beset are known as early as the Middle King- dom but only become frequent in the Ptole- maic period. Beset is regarded as the mother of Bes, sometimes depicted suckling him, but also as his consort (Altenmiiller 1975). The Kawa statue was found broken into many pieces and scattered in a number of rubbish deposits immediately outside Build- ing Al (see Welsby 2001a). Some of the breaks were of very recent date, probably caused when it was being dug out of the ground immediately prior to the commence- ment of excavations on the site in 1998. The form of the piece clearly indicates that it was designed to be set into a wall although total excavation of Building Al failed to find any evidence for where it might have stood.

This is clearly a representation of Bes and forms a pair with the Beset statue. Like Beset, the back is flat and was presumably affixed to a wall. Fragments of two other statues of the same type were recovered from this area and ongoing excavations may be expected to reveal more fragments, if not more figures.

The double uraeus identifies the work as Kushite. The sphinx’s forelegs terminate in human arms and hands, which hold an offering jar on which are inscribed the king's names in a double cartouche: Sekheper-en- Re Senkamenisken. Two other Kushite sphinxes of the same period have forepaws terminating in hands: that of the Kushite princess and ‘God's Wife of Amun’ Shepen- wepet II in Berlin which holds a ram-headed jar (Wildung 1997, 174-5); and the sphinx of Aspelta in Khartoum which holds an offering table. During clearing of the first court of the Great Amun Temple at Jebel Barkal in Janu- ary 1920, Reisner found this sphinx just inside the entrance, facing the temple axis. Just beside it was a small granite stand, inscribed for Atlanersa, on which rested a seated statue of Thutmose III in Heb-Sed robes (Dunham 1970, pl. IVA).

The rondel has been reconstructed. These plaques, and others of various shapes and colours, decorated the exterior of Natakamani’s palace at Jebel Barkal where they had been set into the wall plaster (Donodoni 1993, 102-103, 110; 1994, 56). Similar tondi were used in the decoration of the so-called ‘Royal Baths’ (M 195) at Meroe where they were set in the edge above the basin alternating with statu- ary and other plaques (Térdk 1997b, 75-7. pls 28-34). There, it has been suggested that they may have depicted Maenads, the frenzied women of the Dionysian cult, and formed part of an iconographic programme relating to the use of the baths as a water sanctuary with Dionysian characteristics as derived from the Dionysian cults of Ptolemaic Egypt (Tor6k 1997b, 76-7). The reason for the employ- ment of such a motif on the exterior of a royal palace remains uncertain; however, it may reflect the attribution of some characteristics of the god Dionysos to the Kushite ruler or his attempt to portray himself as a Dionysiac king, as was common among the Ptolemaic pharaohs, most notably Ptolemy IV (cf. Haz- zard 2000, 115-16). JRA",31330,sudan-ancient-treasures-images/31330.png,True,
146,Stela of Piankhi (Piye),Sandstone,SNM 1851,"146 Stela of Piankhi (Piye) Sandstone Kushite (Napatan) (c. 744 Bc) Jebel Barkal, Temple of Amun H (surviving) 1.3 m, W 1.23 m,Th 220 mm SNM 1851 Round-topped royal stela, carved in relief with an offering-scene and hieroglyphic inscriptions, surmounted by a religious motif --- Page 164 --- in the form of a winged sun-disc with pen- dant uraei, the workmanship being of high quality throughout, The stela is very damaged and now incomplete, with its bottom section missing and its surviving lower part much eroded, butis of great historical importance. The scene shows on the right a standing figure of King Piankhi (Piye) (747-716 Bc), identified in the cartouche above him, wear- ing the characteristic Kushite cap-crown with double uraci, facing left and offering a pec- toral and a necklace to a triad of deities (a form of the traditional Theban triad), an enthroned Amen-Ra, followed by a standing Mut and Khons, all facing right. The deities are rendered in raised relief, as was the origi- nal (taller) figure of the king, which was removed (together with his name) at some time after the completion of the stela and then later restored in incised work. The king’s prenomen and nomen were systematically removed wherever they occurred on the stela. Amen-Ra or Amun, shown in his Nubian, ram-headed form, presents to the king the crowns of Egypt and Kush, the red crown of Lower Egypt in his left hand, the Kushite cap- crown in his right (replacing here the tradi- tional white crown of Upper Egypt), signifying a unified kingship and legitimate Kushite dominion over Egypt. Divine sanction of Piankhi’s ascent to the throne is confirmed in the god’s address ‘to his son, whom he loves’. inscribed in the columns of inscription above him: ‘I said concerning you (even when you were still) in the womb of your mother, that you would be ruler of Egypt ... I caused you to receive the Great Crown ... It is I who decreed (the kingship) for you ... No other may decree (who shall be) king’. The king’s acknowledge- ment is recorded in the columns behind him, where he asserts his pre-eminence over all other rulers: Amun of Napata has caused me to be ruler of all foreign countries. To whomso- ever I say “you are chief”, he shall be chief. To whomsoever I say “You are not king”, he shall not be king. Amun in Thebes has caused me to be ruler of Egypt. To whomsoever I say “Make your appearance (as king)”, he shall make his appearance. To whomsoever I say “Do not make appearance”, he shall not make his appearance ... Gods make a king, men make a king, (But) it is Amun who has made me’. The main text of the stela is located directly beneath the offering scene. Arranged in hori- zontal lines reading right to left and down- wards, it records the king's full titulary and epithets, and once continued with a historical narrative, of which only fragments of the beginning now survive. One of these frag- ments crucially bears the remnants of what may be a year date, possibly to be read as ‘(regnal-year) 3’, in which case the stela is Piankhi's earliest known monument. Piankhi’s titulary was clearly inspired by that of one of his great imperial ‘predeces- sors’, King Thutmose III of the 18th Dynasty. as recorded on the latter’s famous victory stela from Jebel Barkal. One especially signifi- cant difference, however. is the form of the king's so-called Horus-name. In the case of Thutmose III, the name is ‘Strong Bull. Appearing (ascending to the throne) in Thebes’: in the case of Piankhi, it is ‘Strong Bull, Appearing in Napata’, a calculated change announcing ‘a momentous reversal of history ... the place of Thebes. where the Egyptian conqueror of Kush had been crowned, was now taken by Napata, where the Kushite ruler of Egypt is crowned’ (Térdk 1997a, 154).

The drilled eyes were once inlaid. The round support on the head has a rectangular socket that would probably have supported a gilt copper-alloy crown of a pair of tall feathers and sun disc with uraeus. The small Amun Temple B 700 at Barkal was built so close to the mountain that it was repeatedly damaged by falls of rock from the cliff. Founded by Atlanersa in the mid-seventh century sc, the temple was completed by Senkamanisken after his predecessor’s pre- mature death. Thenceforth it seems to have served the royal mortuary cult, for the ruins contained small copper-alloy Osiride figures as well as fragments of a large false door of the deceased Atlanersa. When Reisner began clearing the ruins in March 1916, he found the second chamber (B 703) buried under huge rocks. Breaking them up, he was able to expose not only the rest of the room and the fine bark stand of Senkamanisken, now in Boston (Dunham 1970, pls XXX—XXXI), but also a tiny sanctu- ary (B 704) in its rear wall that still contained a small granite altar and a trove of statues. The main figures were this image of Amun, @ fine standing statue of Amenhotep III (ibid.. pls V-VI), and a badly decayed sandstone seated statue of a Kushite king (ibid., pl. LVI) The reused masonry of B 703 revealed that the rear of the temple had been destroyed and rebuilt in the later Napatan or Meroitic period. The small sanctuary B 704 belonged to this later phase, which meant that all the contents had been placed there after it was built, probably after the fourth century BC- The Amun statue was perhaps made as the temple's new cult image.

It was found in 2000 by the Sudanese-Canadian team conducting a surface survey at Meroe. Along both edges of the block two double lines are incised, enclosing an inscription containing a royal name written within a cartouche. Above the cartouche but below the break are two hieroglyphs, the t signs, presumably representing the nsw-bity (king of Upper and Lower Egypt) title - the prenomen. Within the cartouche the signs Imn-in are fully preserved, and a small depression just above the break point is clearly the head of a lion - the I sign. There can be little doubt that the name should be read Imn-Inl, that is, Anlamani, but this is a little unusual as this name normally follows the Son of Ra title. Although examples of Napatan kings using two different titles for the same name are known, this has not been documented with Anlamani thus far. At the south end of M 295 Garstang apparently found a similar architectural fragment bearing the name of the fifth-century ec king Talakhamani (Térdk 1997b, 167, no. 295-1 = insc, 97, fig. 125). Although the first three signs of both royal names (Imn = Amani) are identical, others are not, and therefore Anlamani's inscription comes from a different block, unless Garstang copied the text incorrectly and misread the name.

Bellow nozzles, or tuyéres, were used to force air into the chamber. They were cigar-shaped, hol- lowed inside, and tapered at both ends. They were made of the Nile silt formed round a wooden rod (Tylecote 1982, 30-32). During heating some of the slag remained on the bottom of the furnace, but most of the liquid slag was tapped away through the tap-hole. --- Page 170 --- Often solidified lumps of slag remained attached to the tuyére, as with the present example. Analysis of the iron contents in the ore and in slag suggests a yield of about 20 per cent of the iron in the ore (Tylecote 1982, 40). The presence of mounds of iron slag visible at Meroe and the nearby sites of Hamadab (Wolf 2002a, 93; 2002b, 109-10) and el-Hassa (Lenoble and Rondot 2003) suggests that this was an important indus- trial centre of the Kushite Meroitic kingdom. Iron used in the smelting presumably came from the sedimentary deposit of the ferrugi- nous sandstone common in this area. Remains of iron furnaces were excavated by Shinnie at Meroe (Shinnie and Kense 1982; Tylecote 1982),! enabling the reconstruction of the iron-smelting process.

The ka was a kind of life force, a person's double that was born with them, but survived after death and could receive offerings for the deceased. Each side of the plaque bears an inscription giving the prenomen and nomen of King Aspelta (c. 593-568 nc): ‘King of Upper and Lower Egypt, Merikara, may he live forever’ and ‘Son of Ra’, Aspelta, may he live forever’ (Nagy 1997, 240, insc. 67a, fig. 123). The function of the object is uncertain and its pos- sible funerary meaning may suggest that it actually post-dates the reign of Aspelta. A similarly decorated but smaller and unin- scribed faience object from Sakkara was published as an amulet (Reisner 1907, 158, no. 12260, pl. XX).

It was first published by A.H. Sayce (1909) and has since been republished and reinterpreted several times.! Due to its fragmentary state of preservation, only a few facts are firmly established. The stone is part of a throne, a triumphal monument set up in Meroe by a ‘king of Aksum and Himyar’ (line 1) to mark his victory over the Kushites and the occupa- tion of their capital. Similar inscribed thrones set up by Aksumite rulers recording their victorious campaigns are known from Ethiopia. In line 2, the Aksumite war god Mahrem is referred to by his Greek name Ares. Mention is made of pillaging (line 4) and hostages (line 9). We hear about another king, presumably the king of Kush (line 7), and about a tribute imposed on the defeated Kushites (line 12). The figure in line 14 prob- ably indicates the regnal year of the king. It is uncertain whether the king who set up the throne is identical with the famous King Ezana, dating to before his conversion to Christianity (mid-fourth century), or if it was one of his predecessors.

On either side of the smaller circles are scratched Meroitic owners’ marks, one depicting an acanthus leaf on a shield atop a sacrificial stand. 158 The porringer is of Italian manufacture and belongs to a common first-century ap type, but the angular profile and the low foot- ring may suggest that it is a second-century variant.

Its shape, propor- tions and dimensions are almost identical to three altars of King Natakamani and Queen Amanitore found by Richard Lepsius in 1844 in the ruins of a temple at Wad ban Naqa.! Under the cavetto cornice, the four sides of the altar are decorated in relief. The front side shows the falcon-headed Horus (left) and the ibis-headed Thoth (right) binding papyrus plants around the central hieroglyphic emblem ‘sema’. Above this sign two car- touches are placed, crowned by a sun disc and double ostrich feather. The left (north- ern) cartouche contains the name of King Natakamani, while the right (southern) one the name of Queen Amanitore. Both are written in Meroitic hieroglyphs. The hieroglyphic texts in the horizontal lines above the gods try to imitate Egyptian texts: ‘The lord of the eight, the lord of the divine word, given life’ and ‘The lord of Behedet, the great god, given life’ are familiar epithets of Thoth of Hermopolis and Horus of Edfu; but both texts are nothing but a poor graphic imitation of an original written in Egyptian. This original, an altar of King Atlanersa who lived 650 years before the erection of the Temple of Amun at Naga,? stood in Temple B700 at Jebel Barkal. The same motif is repeated on the rear of the altar (Wildung and Kroeper 2003), this time with Horus on the right and Thoth on the left side; the orientation of the cartouches follows the pattern of the front side with the king to the north and the queen to the south. Reliefs on the right and left sides of the bark stand are divided into two registers. Below, two Nile gods are binding the papyrus plants around the sema with the queen's second — Egyptian — name Meri-ka-ra on the south and the king's second — Egyptian — cartouche Kheper-ka-ra on the north. Above, on both sides, three kneeling male figures with raised arm, jackal-headed and falcon- headed, with the same Egyptian hieroglyphic text ‘the souls of Pe', are preceded by a kneeling figure of the king and the goddess Meret. This decoration is the standard iconog- raphy of bark stands in Egyptian temples since the New Kingdom. Egyptian iconography has become an expression of Kushite royal ideology: the uni- fication of Upper and Lower Egypt, symbol- ized by the sema motif (cf. motif on cat. 76), is the emblematic sign of political and cosmic order under the control of Kushite kingship. A close parallel to this decoration can be found on the altar in the Great Temple of SUDAN: ANCIENT TREASURES Amun in Meroe (M 260). In perfectly cut relief of a strong three-dimensional effect. these figures show a stylistic modification of the Egyptian prototype into a clearly Meroitic artistic expression with heavy limbs and coarse proportions.

The woman on the right wears a short curled wig and a diadem with two uraei, crowned by the white and red crown. On her head a part of the claw of a falcon is preserved, enough to reconstruct the headdress typical for Apedemak's consort, the goddess Amesemi (cat, 163), a double falcon on a crescent. A garment with fringed sleeves, a broad collar and a bracelet complete her cos- tume. Her raised left hand presents the ankh sign to a person facing her; only the right hand of this figure is preserved. The extremely long fingernails of both persons are character- istic of women; therefore the figure on the left of the fragment mus: ve a queen. The ankh sign in the uppermost left corner of the frag- ment is attached to a curved line descending from above, most probably from a sceptre held over the queen by another figure on the extreme left, a god. The symmetrical composi- tion showed the queen between Amesemi and Apedemak. A stela found in the sanctuary of the Amun Temple at Naga (Carrier 2000 (REM 1293), 5-6, 26-7, figs 17-19) presents the same arrangement.

Both are wearing a close-fitting dress descending to the feet, a fringed scarf over the right shoulder, a broad collar and a round curled wig. Otherwise they are repre- sented in very different ways. The left figure has a slim, elegant body; the dress shows a fine pattern of diagonal stripes and dotted lines. A chin-band, an earring, an orna- mented diadem with uraeus and a crown consisting of a pair of falcons with sun-discs sitting on a crescent contrast with the pleated dress and the simple diadem of the extremely corpulent woman on the right. The inscriptions in Meroitic hieroglyphs identify the left figure as Amesemi, the divine consort of the lion god Apedemak (the first complete reference to this name) and the figure to the right as Amanishakheto (with- "" AAA PARD PENA 163: front out cartouche), the well-known Meroitic queen buried in Pyramid N.6 at Begrawiya. The goddess plays the active part: her right hand supports the elbow of the queen's right arm, raised in adoration of Amesemi; her left arm passes behind the queen, the left hand supports the neck of the queen, and a dotted line, starting at the tip of the forefinger, sur- rounds the head of the queen to her forehead. A chain consisting of tiny ankh signs extends from Amesemi's nose to the nose of Aman- ishakheto. This animation by the divine breath is illustrated in a similar way in the reliefs of the Lion Temple at Naga. The rear and the sides of the stela have fifteen lines of text in cursive Meroitic, topped on the rear by a line in Egyptian hieroglyphs without specific meaning. In his still unpub- lished analysis of the Meroitic text Claude Rilly (letter of 8 September 2000) states the SUDAN: ANCIENT TREASURES ‘feeling of frustration’ of the philologist in front of such a well-preserved inscription, but he succeeds at least in defining the character of the text as a religious hymn. Not only does the text keep its secret. but an important historical question also remains open: why and how was a stela of Queen Amanishakheto, dated about sixty years before Natakamani and Amanitore, donated to the Temple of Amun at Naga, a structure not yet in existence during the lifetime of this queen?

The statue type goes back to the cube statue introduced into Egyptian sculpture at about 19 50 ac (cf. cat. 77) and frequently used — mainly as temple statues — until the Ptolemaic period; besides these statues from Naga, this type is other- wise not known in Meroitic art. The style of these small sculptures is also unparalleled. Sculpted in a local workshop, they do not correspond to the stylistic expression of Meroitic art as represented in relief and sculpture of the urban centres, and are unre- lated to Egyptian or Hellenistic influences, Their deeply ‘African’ expression relates them visually to sculptures in West Africa (Nok, Ife) and assigns them a place at the beginnings of African art. The function of these small block statues remains unclear. All of them show traces of rubbing and have lost the original surfaces on both sides.

Originally they belonged to the ram ma» statues, forming a monumental avenue in front of the temple. On all of these twelve statues (and on a thirteenth one behind the temple) the feet of the royal figures can still be seen between the forelegs of the rams. The prototype of these ram statues with royal figures in front can be found in Soleb, in the ram avenue of Amenhotep III. These rams, reused by King Taharko at Temple B 500 of Jebel Barkal, apparently served as direct models for the Naga rams — another case of the close connection between Naga and Napata (cat. 159). The king is represented in mummiform shape, wearing the nemes headdress (the only attestation in Meroitic art) and the royal beard, and holding in his fists the heqa- crook, the flail and an ankh-sceptre descend- ing to the feet. This iconography is the royal SUDAN: ANCIENT TREASURES version of the canonical appearance of the god Khonsu, the son of Amun. The close- fitting cap and side-plait of Khonsu are replaced by the nemes, thus making the king the son of Amun, protected by his father in animal form, Although all these statues belong to a uni- form complex representing the same person.

Sovereigns’ pyramids of the imperial dynasty were probably all investi- gated in succession on four sites. Secondary pyramids and mastabas were also examined on these sites and in Lower Nubia, revealing numerous lower-ranking dignitaries, viceroys in particular. There is little hope of shedding more light on this chronology without further information concerning the empire’s political organization, the order and exact length of the reigns, vicissi- tudes caused by possible divisions and temporary extensions or successions. The chronology stops in the fourth century ap because the construction of pyramids in the southern capital ceased at this point. Victory texts found at Aksum and at Meroe (cat. 155) lead one to suppose that the Meroitic Empire was subjugated by the Aksumite Empire at this time and consequently its funerary tradition came to a halt. The two centuries preceding the Christianization of the Middle Nile attest to the dis- appearance of imperial pyramid necropolises and the substitution of several cemeter- ies with mounds of exceptional size. One may record at least fourteen such sites along the valley (fig. 130). Five are well known in the Nubian desert following the numerous Surveys and excavations upstream from Sadd el Ali (Aswan High Dam); all others in the Sahel await work with only rare and modest soundings undertaken hitherto. A royal chronology for Nubia was recently created for the fourth and fifth centuries ap."" In the richest provinces one may foresee the discovery of important necropolises, either now poorly known or as yet unknown. The poverty of the southern docu- mentation hinders any detailed description of the evolution of a unified Kushite Empire into the three kingdoms successively Christianized in the sixth century AD. THE PROBLEMATIC IDENTIFICATION OF PRE-CHRISTIAN SOVEREIGNTY Due to general pillaging, a funerary crown has never been found beneath a pyra- mid. Nevertheless, it is not difficult to recognize Kushite rulers’ graves. Qore and dignitaries maintained royal workshops (scribes, architects, masons, sculptors, painters, bronzesmiths, etc.) for the creation of royal propaganda. Dozens of inscriptions and representations from funerary chapel reliefs and objects buried in the graves name and depict sovereigns and dignitaries, and help us to reconstruct the hierarchy and the prosopography of the Empire. --- Page 188 ---",3011,sudan-ancient-treasures-images/30115b.png,False,sudan-ancient-treasures-images/30115b.png

The mane, which is indicated in low relief, terminates at the back in a knot, and between this and the ears is carved a large scarab with triple wings. There is a prominent collar around and below the face. A rectangular ‘apron’ covers the chest and upper front legs, decorated with a pectoral of seven strands of pendant beads. Above these are two cartouches 190 mm high containing text in Meroitic hieroglyphs: ‘The Lord of the Two Lands, the king ever-living Amanikhabale’. This lion, one of several found at Basa (see also cat. 2), came from the west side of the hafir where it was set on a pedestal made from two courses of red brick covered in plaster. The lion was a potent symbol of the might of the Kushite state, and is frequently associated with the ruler who sits on a lion throne and is accompanied by a lion mauling prisoners — as on the pylons of the Lion Temple at Naqa. The lion is also associated with one of the chief gods of the Kushite state, Apedemak, who is fre- quently shown as a lion-headed human figure. Apedemak was the Kushite god of war and also of fertility. In this guise his presence at a hafir is very appropriate. Hafirs were presumably con- structed by the Kushite state to provide water for the transhuming and nomadic populations of the Keraba and Butana. After the wet season, when surface water became scarce, these people would have been forced to congregate with their animals at the hafirs. The lion statues and the nearby temple will have demonstrated to them the power and might of the state, and presumably the state would have taken the opportunity to tax them at this point. = DAW Crowfoot 1911, 14-17, pl.

The site was discovered in 1993 by a Sudan Archaeological Research Society (SARS) survey team directed by Michael Mallinson and Laurence Smith. With the encouragement of the Sudan National Corporation for Antiquities and Museums, SARS undertook a large-scale rescue excavation during the winter of 1994-5, prior to the construction of a new highway across the site. The Post-Meroitic component of this large and well-preserved cemetery was of considerable research interest. Recent work in the Shendi Reach has greatly increased our understanding of cultural transitions at the end of the Meroitic period (third-fourth centuries AD). However, Gabati has proved very interesting in having burials of the later Post-Meroitic and early medieval period (fifth-seventh centuries ap), through the period which saw the introduction of Christianity to the region. Previously very little was known of this period in the central Sudan except from excavations of the earliest levels black stones. The majority of the tombs were con- structed with large trapezoidal shafts, with a steeply sloping entrance ‘ramp’ with wide ledges cut along the sides. The oval or semi-circular grave chambers were accessed through narrow entrances cut in the end wall of the shaft. Similar grave forms have been found at el-Hobagi, but have not yet been found elsewhere. In contrast to the earlier Meroitic burials, in which graves were frequently reopened and reused, the Post- Meroitic tombs only held a single burial. This appears to be a significant and widespread change in practice at the end of the Meroitic period. Most of the grave om were oriented along an approximately east-west axis, with the bodies in the grave chambers laid in a con- tracted position, oriented north-south, as was the en with the earlier Meroitic burials on the site. The bodies were usually laid on their right sides with the head to the south, facing east, apparently a relatively standard arrangement during this period (fig. 144). The range of artefacts found with the burials was quite extensive (cats 175-8, 314-16), although there is no particular reason to believe that the people were",26311,sudan-ancient-treasures-images/26311_originallyAttachedTo26310.png,False,sudan-ancient-treasures-images/26311_originallyAttachedTo26310.png

A dark orange band runs around the rim while the body of the vessel is painted a lighter orange. A decorative brown band with a zig-zag motif runs around the interior of the bowl just under the rim, and a flower rosette is painted in the centre. The inscription reads: ‘Lazaros the archiman- drite’. It is preceded by the name Michael written five times in a cryptographic form, ‘689’, this being the sum of the numerical value of the individual Greek letters in the name Michael. This type of cryptography is often used in texts from medieval Nubia. The bowl comes from Room 21 in the North-western Annexe. This space was used as a midden during the Terminal Christian Period. The bowl belongs to a table set of Lazaros, an abbot of the Monastery of the Holy Trinity. Fragments of sixteen other pieces were found in the area of the monastery, including a large bowl, six smaller footed bowls or deep plates, three saucers, five cups of different forms and one storage jar. On some vessels the text refers to Lazaros along with his title of archimandrites (abbot) and contains the monastery denomination, the Holy Trinity, and his other title arch(i)styl(ites).

The text, but for some minor surface damage. is entirely preserved. Faint guidelines indicat- ing both the bottom and top of the letters are visible in lines 14 and 7 of the inscription. The hand may be described as round epi- graphic majuscles.! The stonemason used nomina sacra in lines 2 and 7. He abbreviates words through shifting the last written letter as in line 5, or by crossing the last written letter by an oblique stroke. Numerals are marked by a horizontal dash above, and f in line 5 also has points on both of its sides. The initial iota in the names Toadz and TaxwB has a trema. Letter heights range between 11 and 25 mm. The text reads: ‘Through the inclination and order of the living God, Markos, a Hegemon, fell asleep in the month of Phamenoth [day] 2nd, in the 9th indiction, in the year from Diocletian 502. God of spirits and of all flesh, rest his soul in the bosom of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob, in a shining place, ina place of refreshment. from which pain and grief and lamentation have fled away.’ The formula vetoe zai xeZeboer, found in the first three lines, is rare. It is found in the epitaph of Petros, Eparch of Nobadia (died ap 798), recovered at Old Dongola (cat. 186).? It also occurs in a fragmentarily preserved epitaph from Khor Dam Et-Tor near Bageri (Lajtar 2003, 73). The office of Hegemon is attested here for the second time so far in Christian Nubia. The other attestation is yielded by an epitaph, now in the Sudan National Museum, commemorating a Hege- mon with the name Theodorou (Theodoros). The Theodorou epitaph may be dated on palaeographic grounds to the eighth-tenth centuries. According to the Museum register, it came to light in Tangasi. There are two villages of this name between the Third and Fourth Cataracts: one on the right bank immediately south-east of Banganarti,* and the other on the left bank several kilometres west of Merowe. The discovery of the epitaph of the Hegemon Markos at Banganarti argues strongly for the former of these two villages as the provenance of the epitaph of the Hege- mon Theodorou. It can be hypothesized that both Hegemones were originally buried not far from each other, in the cemetery surrounding the ‘Lower Church’ at Banganarti. The exact meaning of the term Hegemon rel- ative to Christian Nubia remains unknown.* Since in the Eastern Roman Empire of the fifth-sixth centuries, the word Hegemon was a quasi-technical term for the governor of a province (Lat. praefectus, praeses), we may SUP- pose that the same or similar meaning may also be applied to it in Nubia. The Hegemones Markos and Theodorou living in the eighth- tenth centuries may have been governors of some administrative units within the King- dom of Makuria. Indiction and the Era of Diocletian are the standard systems used to indicate a year in early epitaphs from Nubia until the first half of the tenth century. Both indications agree with each other here, which is not always the case in Nubian inscriptions. The present epi- taph is the second oldest dated funerary inscription from the Dongola area, the oldest being the epitaph of a woman, Kel, discovered at Old Dongola and dated to ap 785."" The prayer for the dead contained in lines 7-16, is clearly modelled on the prayer a the Euchologion Mega-type characteristic of Nubian funerary inscriptions. It preserves from this prayer the initial invocation to God and a list of places of eternal rest for the deceased S soul. The prayer from Markos’s epitaph seems to have no exact parallel in Nubian epitaphs written in Greek, but more or less oad prayers do occur; the differences consist in : e kind of invocation and the choice of names al the places of rest. The epitaph of arene inating from Merowe is one such example.",31225,sudan-ancient-treasures-images/31225.png,True,

L460 mm, W 360 mm SNM 31251 This roughly rectangular marble funerary stela belongs to an Alwan king named David. It is one of the few royal tombstones known and the only one of a king of Alwa. It is inscribed with twenty lines of Greek, below which three crosses are incised. The first three lines of the text are slightly larger in size than the follow- ing registers. It may have been set into the floor of a church in a fashion similar to the stela of Mariankouda (cat. 318). This may account for the illegible, worn text in the centre of the stone. The edges are also worn. The text con- tains a Nubian version of a common Byzantine prayer for the dead known as the Ebyohoyiov Heya. The humble nature of this stone may be contrasted with the more opulent, finer stela of Mariankouda. This may be a reflection of King David's personal piety or an indication of the type of raw materials and the level of skilled artisans available in Makuria as opposed to Alwa. The inscription reads as follows: ‘O God of the spirits and all flesh, Thou who hast rendered death ineffectual and has trodden down Hades, and hast given life to the world, rest the soul of [Thy] servant David, the King, in the bosom of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob, in a place of light, in a place of verdure, in a place of refreshment, whence grief and pain and mourning hath fled.

Its arms are of equal length, the ends of which are rounded and have been hammered flat to create a splayed appearance. A 130 mm- long spike, rectangular in cross-section, tapers downward from the bottom arm. This spike suggests that the cross was fitted into a wooden handle enabling it to be carried by hand, or was mounted in a staff or inserted into the back of a chair or throne. All three alternatives are depicted in the wall paintings discovered at Faras (Michatowski 1974, nos 19, 30, 35, 39). The numerous crosses, par- ticularly of iron, discovered at Soba indicate the widespread nature of Christianity among the population and might indicate preferen- tial usage of this metal. Iron was a valued commodity and it has been suggested that it was credited with apotropaic properties, par- ticularly during phases or ceremonies of transition such as initiation, births and deaths (Zurawski 1994a, 211-12).

This influenced cultural development as Arabic-speaking nomads entered the country from the seventh century ap onwards via Sinai, the Eastern Desert and the Red Sea. Sudan with its vast area, varied geo- graphical zones and peoples presents a unique pattern of Islamic archaeology in Africa (fig. 172). By the time the process of Islamization was well underway, regional resistance stemming from popular beliefs was strong and had to be overcome. Islamization was carried out to some extent by Muslims who immigrated to Sudan during the earliest Islamic period; however, the majority of this process was accomplished by indigenous individuals and/or groups who had previously converted to Islam, probably through the mediation of the aforementioned immi- grants.! The country as we know it was never part of an Islamic Caliphate except for a narrow strip of the Nile stretching downstream from the Third Cataract towards Egypt and the port of Suakin on the Red Sea coast. Both were part of the Ottoman Empire, so one would not expect Islam's cultural manifestations in Sudan to have been modelled after those of Egypt, Iraq or Iran. The rise of the al-'Umari state in the Eastern Desert, the Tunjur and the Keira Sultanates in the west, and the Funj Kingdom in central Sudan was only the culmination of a slow process of Arab migration. Three distinct phases in this lengthy and complex process can be recognized: Phase I — Ap 640-1300 (An 20-680) Phase II — av 1300-1500 (an 680-920) Phase III — av 1500-1800 (an 920-1480) Puase J Islamization began gradually in av 641 through contact with the first Muslims in Egypt, who signed a treaty with the kingdom of Makuria. This treaty, known as the Baqt, was primarily commercial but allowed for the slow infiltration of the nomadic tribes of Arabia into Sudan. Evidence for Islamization includes a mosque which is mentioned in the Baqt Treaty. A mosque is later referred to by al-Aswani in the late --- Page 240 --- SUDAN: ANCIENT TREASURES Tafa Qetassi_ |S An EGYPT Kalabsha } ‘SAUDI Qasr brim 4oELDerr pat ARABIA a f Aidhab @ N WADA S ""7"", Deraheib om Kulubnarti ing , ‘ie "" Thiae EASTERN \ “Seale a Hannek DESERT % fie Mia | Suakine. y El-Khandaq Badign. — Old Dongola Khor Nubt > SUDAN ij , cies ‘i CHAD P| Cran Uri : a Ain Farah e° Kobbe + 6 x Kabkabiyae ° ° f El-Fasher 0 e€l-Obeid ' 4 | Mey 7 | 7 , | goN Te Sein ee | J / Teed | CENTRAL —_— AFRICAN “tea, \ REBUBLIC ‘ ? in j , Mees a Se, ‘. 4 \ oS eel ~ 7 ‘ su Se 5",31240,sudan-ancient-treasures-images/31242_31241_31240.png,False,sudan-ancient-treasures-images/31242_31241_31240.png

The motif of this impression is thus far unique. Luckily enough, the corresponding stamp (cat. Ame) Was also found in this deposit. While excavating test trenches in 1996 for a new architectural plan in the northern Courtyard 224 of the Great Enclosure at Musawwarat es-Sufra many sherds of Meroitic fine wares, both painted and/or stamped, were found. Although a few sam- ples of Meroitic fine wares had come to light during the 1960s when B, Hintze excavated in this location, this find was unexpected. Subsequently, in 1997, a 5 x 5-m trench was opened and approximately 22,500 sherds were excavated, Among the masses of house- hold wares mixed with ashes, almost 15 per cent consisted of beautiful pottery — an extremely high percentage. All of these sherds originate from a pottery workshop that flour- ished between the first century ue and the first century Ab, Similar pottery of this quality has been found, but only in a royal context (i.e., in pyramids or the palaces of the Royal City of Meroe). That these high-quality vessels were produced at Musawwarat es-Sulra indicates that the royal court visited from time to time. Because no traces of a kiln were found, it soon became clear that this pottery was pro- duced in an open bonfire. Traces of the fire are still visible on the inside walls of the north-eastern corner of courtyard 224. Asa result of the poor firing process, many vessels collapsed during firing. These fine wares were made of local clay, with some of the vessels made of kaolin clay. Primarily three colours were used (purple, black and red). Among the refuse were min- erals, but also some of the potters’ tools: hard-fired stamps for impressing designs on wet clay (cat. 225) and a slow potter's wheel (cat. 224). This is the first time that ancient potters’ tools were identified in the Sudan. Motifs, both painted and stamped, are typi- cally Meroitic: some are religious (Hathor, sa-knot) and royal (uraei: cat. 227), while others show plants (vine leaves: cat. 229) or common designs (guilloche, stars: cat. 228). Although similar pottery has been found in the Royal City of Meroe and at Hamadab. there is no exact parallel to that found at Musawwarat, which suggests that the potters at Musawwarat had their own ‘hand-writing’ and artistic traditions.

In the upper part a hole through the cone for a String or a leather strap would allow the stamp to be hung. On the circular base the concave stamp is impressed and incised. It represents the Holy Lamb, which stands in front of a chalice with the eucharis- tic bread. Identification of the animal, which resembles an antelope, is stressed by the inscription in Greek (mirror image) above the spine of the lamb: O AMNOZ TOY OY, ‘The Lamb of God’. The lamb’s head is embellished with the cross. The cross with pendants between its arms appears also on the eucharis- tic bread. The scene is surrounded by two con- centric circles and by a circle of satellite dots which allows us to date the stamp to the Clas- sic Christian period (Adams 1986, 222). The Stamp was found among the rubble of Room 2 of the service area of the Monastery of the Holy Trinity (Zurawski 1994b, 340, fig. 15). The most probable use of the stamp was to decorate pottery. In the collection of Nubian pottery in the National Museum in Warsaw there are two examples of centrepieces from small bowls with almost identical scenes impressed (238168 MN; 238169 MN). The stamp, however, could also have been used to decorate eucharistic loaves before baking (cf. Galey 1980, fig. 177) KP",31213,sudan-ancient-treasures-images/31213.png,True,

Their crescent- like form with wedge-shaped cross section and slightly concave upper surface made them useful for stabilizing pots with rounded bottoms on the flat surfaces of the kiln’s firing chamber. Another potential function was the separation of large vessels that were stacked in piles, in order to improve the circulation of hot gases and to promote the even oxidation of their surfaces during the firing process.

In Old Dongola, at Kom R1, the thickest rubble of such layers reached 4.6 m (Pluskota 2001, 360). The high percentage of pot- sherds in the debris indicates that either ‘Nubian potters were not careful enough’ (Adams 1986, I, 32) or that the speed of mass production resulted in numerous breakages. Some of the vessels were smashed during the removal from the kilns, but most of them broke in the kilns during firing or the subsequent stage of cooling.

A spout protrudes from one end, while there is an opening for the addition of liquids on top. Often these vessels are given zoomorphic attributes: including those of bulls, rabbits and elephants, and have an animal head at the spout end, hollow stubby legs on the underside and a tail at the oppos- ing end. Frequently a round or strap handle joins the body at the back of the animal head. This vessel has a spout in the shape of an ele- phant head. A small wrapped or hooded figure stands atop its head. Aquamanile form a distinctive class of green-glazed, wheel-made vessels at Soba. The SUDAN: ANCIENT TREASURES glaze on most aquamanile found at Soba remains a powdery yellow-lime slip as they were not fired at a temperature high enough to vitrify the glaze. The fabric of these vessels is fine and ranges in colour from brick-red to pale orange. This is the only known produc- tion of glazed ware in Nubia. Though no closely analogous vessels are present from Egypt, aquamanile are found throughout the Near East. Close parallels to the Soba vessels may be found in twelfth- to thirteenth-century AD Persia (Watson 1985, figs 97, 98): how- ever, unlike their counterparts, the Soba vessels are non-functional and appear to be rudimentary local imitations. The local manu- facturer was clearly unaware of the functional aspects of these vessels. The handles are weak and would have difficulty supporting the weight of the vessel when filled, and often the spouts do not perforate the body.

D 54 mm; interior rim: D 224 mm SNM 26899 This caliciform beaker (cf. cats 22, 271), made by the coil technique, has undoubtedly had its lower part shaped by means of modelling. Both external and internal surfaces were slipped and burnished. On the interior this treatment does not reach further than the waist. It is dec- orated by the incision technique. The opening is very wide and carries an internal decoration made up of a series of five incised triangles, joined together and facing five others whose surfaces have only been burnished and present a ‘rippled ware’ appearance. The body is divided into three bands, the middle one having been left without decoration. The other two are divided into panels by thin vertical bands, themselves divided into two by a thin band that runs vertically, forming angular motifs of the chevron kind. The compartments thus marked out are filled with incised parallel and oblique lines that are encrusted with a white substance in order to highlight the deco- ration. It should be emphasized that this deco- ration exactly matches that on the bow! found in the same grave and so must have been made by the same person. Placed on the edge of the grave cut together with a pestle and ten bivalve shells, it belonged to a man whose burial was rich in grave goods.

In the older archaeological literature they were called ‘wine jars’, but a more differentiated function for transport and storage is probable. Many were exported to Nubia filled with miscella- neous commodities, and during the Terminal A-Group phase much of this trade was concentrated in the southern parts of Lower Nubia. Potmarks, probably related to exchange and ownership, were common. These precious jars had a long life. They were often reused and mended, having repair holes along old cracks.

Running around the rim immediately below it is a register of holes, pierced before firing from the exterior towards the interior. Traces of red ochre suggest that a coloured red strip of leather (?) was once threaded through the holes. Alternatively, because traces of colour were not found in the holes, the effect of a strip may have been simply painted on. It has been suggested that the holes were for hang- ing the bowl, but the traces of colour and the close spacing of the holes suggest that they were more likely to have been for additional decoration in the form of a trim. Two sets of holes further down the body were possibly intended as ‘suspension holes’, although their location does not seem suitable for this pur- pose.

The highly polished surface of the vessel was created by burnishing the sur- face with a pebble; the red colour results from the application of red ochre. Both were done before firing in an oxidizing (oxygen-rich) atmosphere. The black top was created by upending the vessel into a reducing atmos- . phere during firing (Gratien 1978, 220-28). The Kerma Ancien period does not display a wide variety of vessel forms.

It has little affinity with the ceramics of the earlier Kushite period or with other medieval Nubian wares, It was produced in the vicinity of Soba, suggesting the presence of a thriving local ceramic industry there during the early medieval period. Imported wares are rare at this time at Soba, Many characteristic styles are present, with painted designs applied on the exterior and occasion- ally the interior overtop of brown, red or --- Page 272 --- -ooed surfaces. Usually the interior and =» ior are slipped with the same colour; howeve:, when differing colours are used sometimes the darker slip is extended over the rim to form a band around the rim on the interior or exterior. Bowls, basins, jars, cups, chalices (cats 193, 198) and lids are the pri- mary vessel forms used. The painted decora- tion appears to be strongly influenced by Christian decorative artistic traditions as seen in contemporary Nubian wall paintings. A wide range of distinctive designs are pre- sent, with the decoration commonly situated within horizontal or vertical registers. Deco- rative motifs include human faces, roundels, animals such as lions, birds, frogs and gazelle, backgrounds filled with dots, ovals or crosses, repeating friezes and geometric patterns. Crosses are among the most common motifs. Bosses may also be painted and modelled in the shape of animal heads. Some of these motifs are quite distinct and might suggest the hand of one artist, or of a school or group following a set pattern.

Black and White Dec- orated Ware is distinct and seems to be associ- ated only with certain forms and fabrics, primarily jars of the narrow-mouthed, thin- walled or enclosed varieties such as pilgrim flasks. It is much rarer than Soba Ware, sug- gesting that it might have been imported to the Soba region. Analogous examples have been discovered at Old Dongola and Gabati (cat. 258), and there may have been a kiln producing this ware in the vicinity of Old Dongola. The exterior surface of these vessels is usually covered with orange or red slip on to which the design is applied in black paint. Spaces within the pattern are then filled in white; however, in certain instances the posi- tions of the red/orange slip and the white are 259, 260 (top centre) reversed, Common decorations include boxes or discs filled with cross-hatching, horizontal bands containing crosses, triangles or dia- monds, horizontal or vertical arrangements of ovals and decorative motifs that cover the pot body but are not restricted to registers or linear arrangements, JRA/DAW Welsby 1998a, 119, 136-9, 170 SUDAN: ANCIENT TREASURES iS) “I 1 --- Page 273 --- SI tS) SUDAN: ANCIENT TREASURES",31265,sudan-ancient-treasures-images/31266_31265.png,False,sudan-ancient-treasures-images/31266_31265.png

This type of receptacle is found in the central Sudan, but in those Cases the opening is simply the extension of the body. Here, the neck is marked by an inflexion of the wall of the pot. In a Neolithic context the ‘bottle forms’ indicate a late date. The body is undec- orated, but has been slipped, and its exterior has been lightly burnished, the interior smoothed. The decoration is limited to the rim, as is common, with a series of incised lines forming a lozenge-shaped pattern. The diversity of the forms in this cemetery is char- acteristic of the final phases of the Neolithic.

Its general shape is lanceolate; the thick base was shaped by the removal of a few large flakes whereas the tip was carefully trimmed by alternating sec- ondary retouch. It is made from locally avail- able Nubian sandstone. This object was found on a land surface dating to the late Middle Pleistocene, amongst a small scatter of arte- facts containing one other handaxe and numerous production flakes from a third. The latter handaxe itself was not present. The small Acheulian cluster overlies a wider distribution of Early/Middle Palaeolithic, Sangoan artefacts. The latter are always made out of quartz and are radically different in terms of typology. This evidence indicates that these are the remains of two separate occupation events by humans with very dif- ferent behaviour patterns, who were roaming in the same landscape. Evidence of other Early/Middle Palaeolithic and Late Acheulian occupations were found below the present one, suggesting that the Early to Middle Palacolithic transition was a rapid phenomenon caused by population replacement, The handaxe is covered with a calcitic crust as a result of pedogenetic processes occurring in the early Late Pleistocene.

This particular object was probably prepared at the spot where the quartz was exploited, and brought to Site 8-B-11 in a more or less prepared state. At this site it received its final preparation: its insertion into a haft. Core-axes are characteristic tools for an Early/Middle Palaeolithic tool industry called SUDAN: ANCIENT TREASURES the Sangoan. Until recently, the latter was believed to be a sub-Saharan phenomenon. The discovery of three well-defined Sangoan levels at Sai provides the first firm evidence for a much larger distribution of the Sangoan throughout Africa.

A natural slab was shaped into a roughly rectangular form by removing large flakes from the sides. Then one face of the slab was made flat by pecking it with a stone hammer, except for two areas where the natural surface of the slab was preserved. A large depression was cut out, surrounded by a series of small holes that seem to have origi- nated as a result of a rotating movement. It may have served as a grinding stone or mortar. After a fracture along the edge. in the area of the depression. the object was reshaped by means of obverse flakes. Two of these were recovered nearby and were refitted at the right edge of the object. Its present shape, therefore, is the result of a reworking of the grinding stone, perhaps an oppor- tunistic adaptation to a new function. This is one of the earliest examples in the world of an intensively shaped grinding stone. In fact. such objects are extremely rare throughout the Palaeolithic period. It testifies to complex behaviour in the Early/Middle Palaeolithic.

Around the face, which is sculpted in the round, a tripartite wig falls on the shoul- ders and back. On the chest some beads represent the ousekh-collar. A hole through the head shows that the object was intended to be hung around the neck. This hybrid object is a good illustration of an important Egyptian idea regarding the heart. It was not only the main organ in the body - the place where all the vital functions converged in life as well as in the afterlife, mainly at the crucial moment of the Judgement — but it was also thought to be a real being, here indicated by its personification through a human head. The pendant shown here is uninscribed and undecorated. Sometimes similar items give the name of the deceased or representations of the benou-bird, the purple heron or phoenix, thought to be the soul of the sun god Ra. This human-headed version of the object is not known before the 19th Dynasty. Some examples have been found in New Kingdom Egyptian or Nubian cemeteries such as Gurob (Petrie 1890, pl.

It looks like a a twisted and knotted piece of cloth, and so has been named ‘Isis knot’ by Egyptologists. It has been modelled in dark red faience and the upper ties painted in black. The verso is flat. The front side bears the name of the deceased, inscribed between two vertical lines, the whole painted in black. He is the ‘Osiris’ Userhat. One of the most frequently found in a funerary context, either in pictorial form as represented in the vignettes of the Book of the Dead, or as a real prophylactic ornament, this amulet symbolized protection by the blood of the goddess Isis. It was frequently associated with another amulet, the djed-pillar, symbol of the Ruler of the Realm of the Dead, Osiris. A special spell of the Book of the Dead is dedicated to the tyet-amulet, pre- scribing that it must be made of red jasper, hung on a cord made of sycamore fibre and placed around the neck of the deceased on his burial day. By this means, the deceased could get the magic power of Isis and have 284 SUDAN: ANCIENT TREASURES his body protected in the Underworld. Another proof that the present object was intended to be used in a funerary context is the inscription which specifies that its owner has become ‘an Osiris’. This means he is now united with this god in the ‘Field of Offerings’, having passed the test of the weighing of his heart against the feather of truth (ma‘at), in the presence of the divine tribunal presided over by Osiris.

This deity, very popular in Egypt. was gener- ally represented as an old dwarf with a curly beard, stylized lion’s mane, protruding tongue and squashed nose (cf. cats 142-3, 166). It was believed that because of his strange and terrifying appearance Bes could ward off evil and catastrophe. Thus he was the special pro- tector of expectant mothers. As a domestic deity, his image was commonly used to deco- rate pieces of furniture or toilet objects. His image was also worn as an amulet around the neck or tattooed on the body. The example shown here has been cut in a semi-precious stone and the face's features only roughly indicated by short incised lines.

Each eye consists of a shape in faience, lengthened by a cosmetic line towards the temple. The form is hollow and contains the remains of a paste forming the cornea in which the pupil, a hard black stone, polished and brilliant, was inserted. The colours of these two eyes have certainly been altered, due either to some combustion or to some contact with another type of material: the faience is grey and the white paste is in some places bluish. One of the pupils has become red. It is very often the case that these eyes are the only evidence for the presence of a wooden sarcophagus. Many examples have been found in copper, instead of faience.

The vases have the usual shape of canopic jars, with a high rounded shoulder closing on a narrow collar and with a narrow flat base; the fabric is fine, the colour of chamois (yel- lowish-brown), and it is covered with a bright burnished red slip. The rather conical lid has a concave base to match the profile of the vase. It is provided with a small extension and is surmounted with a human head moulded in the round; the features, of which the eyes, nose and mouth are indicated by light relief work, are framed by a wide wig. This shape imitates that of the human-headed canopic jars of the 18th Dynasty. These miniature vases had a magical role and did not contain any organic remains. Models of canopic jars such as these, with well-known context, are not so common in Egypt and Nubia during this period, and it is interestizg to note that, in Sai island, another complete group as well as four lids and elements of other groups were brought to light in that particular cemetery.

It was found ° with the beautiful shabti of ‘Count’ Neby for whom it was intended. The sandstone sar- cophagus consists of a coffer with an anthro- pomorphic lid and imitates the type of coffin in use in the 18th Dynasty. The lid, whose decoration is almost completely erased, was originally painted in black. It contained four white columns — a vertical median band and three horizontal columns - reserved for a text which had not been inscribed. The columns continue on the coffer which is also black, and on the bottom of the lid. On the lid the human head wears a wide, originally black tripartite wig, which leaves the ears free. The features of the face, the eyes, nose and mouth, are sculpted in relief: one of the pupils retains its black colour. This evokes in minia- ture the bitumen-coated sarcophagi with inscribed bands on a black ground. The four holes for mortises correspond to each other, on opposite sides, on the box and on the lid. Remains of a red colour are preserved inside the coffer which must have been repaired in the ancient past, because on the base three wide grooves have been hollowed out to receive the bonding medium.

Carved in calcite (alabaster), they represent two of the sons of Horus — the human-headed Imsety, who guarded the liver, and the baboon-headed Hapy, who protected the lungs. Stylistically, the lids are indistin- guishable from Egyptian examples, and they were almost certainly made by experienced Egyptian craftsmen. Differences in scale and technique suggest that two different sculptors may have produced them, a circumstance seen in other sets of visceral containers from Egypt. A set of four jars, made of stone, pottery or wood, formed an important element of the traditional Egyptian elite burial. These vessels, known to Egyptologists as canopic jars, were the receptacles for the viscera that were removed from the corpse during mummifi- cation. Liver, lungs, stomach and intestines were each placed in a separate jar, the lid of which was carved to represent the head of a deity. These gods, the Sons of Horus, were responsible for the protection of the various body parts. The jars were introduced in the Old Kingdom around 2500 sc. With changes in mummification procedures, in about 1100 ac, the preserved viscera began to be replaced inside the body, but empty or dummy canopic jars continued to be deposited in the tomb, out of respect for tradition (cf. cat. 287). Beginning with Piankhi (Piye), the Kushite kings gradually adopted more and more features of Egyptian funerary practice. They were buried beneath pyramids, and their bodies were mummified and enclosed in anthropoid coffins, Canopic jars, shabti figures and amulets of Egyptian type were placed in their tombs, The two missing lids and the jars to which they belonged had been plundered from Shabaqo's tomb; it is likely, however, that they were either solid ‘dummies’ or contained only --- Page 296 --- » oc! scentary cavity, since it was not until the «oign of Tahargo that canopic jars began once raore to fulfil their practical purpose of holding the viscera.

According to Egyptian custom these were small figures that took the form of the mummy of the deceased (cf. cats 290-91) and were thought to be his magical alter egos. Just as, in life, the king could call upon his subjects to perform such hard labour as dredging canals and hauling sand, it was also feared that in the afterlife even the king might be called to work by the great god. Shabtis, it was believed, made it possible to avoid this work. Tahargo’s shabtis are individually inscribed with a standard text that explains their purpose: If anyone summons King Tahargo to his work [in the City of the Dead?] indeed, there is a good reason why he should not do it! [?] for you, Shabti, shall say: Anyone may summon at any time and I shall act according to orders, whether it be planting fields, irrigating river banks, or even if it be conveying the sands of the west bank to the east and vice versa. If anyone orders forth King Tahargo, the justified, to do any of the work which is customarily done in the City of the Dead, then verily I shall do it, and I shall speak up in the City of the Dead, saying: I am hel’ Taharqo's shabtis range in height from 180 to 600 mm and are carved of speckled gran- ite, green ankerite, or white calcite. They were placed standing around the walls of the tomb's chambers and corridors, sometimes two and three rows deep. They wear either the khat headdress or the nemes royal crown (with one uraeus rather than two), and they hold the royal crook and flail, or hoes and baskets (slung over the shoulders), or in some cases djed amulets symbolizing eternity. Certain repetitive details and facial features reveal the hands of different sculptors, The 293 fact that calcite is only found in Egypt sug- gests that some or all of the shabtis were carved there and shipped south in prepara- tion for the king's burial.

The representation on this table, in the name of Netemkhor (cf. cat. 304), identifies the ceremony: in the centre is Isis holding a small round vase, while facing her is Anubis with a jackal head, pouring for the dead person the libation over loaves of bread and trussed ducks piled up over an altar-chapel.

Medieval graves were orientated east-west, with the head usually to the west. The grave monu- ments were built of irregularly-shaped stones infilled with small pebbles and soil, forming a ‘box’ over the actual burial. Grave 92, how- ever, did not have an associated superstruc- ture. If such a monument had been provided it must have been demolished during the later use of the cemetery. This rectangular grave measured 1.4 x 0.35 m and was 0.98 m deep. A series of flat stones spanned the ledges on either side of the body so that it was protected from the grave infill. This is a common occur- rence in burials of this period. Usually the body was laid on its back in an extended posi- tion, but this skeleton was either too large for the grave or had been deliberately placed in a flexed position. The body was wrapped in a coarsely woven brown shroud which was held in place by a cord around the head, neck, waist, knees and feet. In order to preserve the 316 --- Page 308 --- SUDAN: ANCIENT TREASURES integrity of the burial, the body has remained unwrapped and therefore any demographic or pathological analysis must await radio- graphic examination.

Ten fragments were preserved. Part of the bottom of the inscription and edge are miss- ing. A raised rim, 40 mm wide, encloses the inscription and the face is polished while the back is smoothed. Three small crosses are incised above the inscription and one incised cross is preserved below the text. Prior to carv- ing the inscription, several register lines were lightly engraved and remain visible, The text contains twenty-eight lines of incised Greek. It bears a late ninth-century date, the name of the Makurian king, Georgios, and mentions the name of Mariankouda and his administra- tive title, Tetrarchos — the only reference to this office discovered thus far. Mariankouda was probably buried in a crypt close to the inscrip- tion, The Mariankouda stela is similar to the circular inscription of King Georgios discov- ered in Egypt in the Wadi Natrun (Griffith 1928, 124), Another similar stela was discov- ered in the Cathedral of the Brick Pillars at Old Dongola embedded in the floor in a compara- ble manner (Gartkiewicz 1990, 302, pl. 177a), and two fragments from a different round stela were recently found in excava- tions at Kom H, Old Dongola (Lajtar 2003, pers. comm.). This extremely fine stela, of a high-ranking Makurian official, contrasts dramatically with the poor quality stela of the Alwan king David (cat. 197), both in the sophistication of the Greek text and quality of material utilized. The inscription reads as follows: ‘O patient, compassionate, very merciful, true God, You, at the beginning, have created man according to Your likeness and resemblance and then, when he, through the trick of the snake, has fallen out from the paradise of joy and, as a consequence of his disobedience, was subjected to death and became different from You, the one that you have held in esteem, [and You], in Your unspeakable glory, did not overlook [his] troublesome life and wearisome living but in Your mercy have shown compassion on him and were willing to look for and to save the sheep that was led astray and have sent Your only-begotten son that having been born of woman was subjected to law in order that he would redeem those who were subjected to law, for which reason he directly has come (and), after receiving a human body and becoming man and through ascending onto the wood [= cross] has saved all those who were subjected to death, [and] on the account of what God said to Adam ‘you are earth and into earth you will turn again’, through the aw inclination and will of God the me blessed Mariankouda, son of T[.Jophena, Tetrarch of the land of Makouria, has fallen asleep in the month of Payni [day] 11th, in the year from thes Martyrs 603, from his birth until his destiny he lived 72 years receiving all hi authority from the order of our blessed orthodox King Georgios. Wherefore we beseech you, o Lord, rest this very Caesar in the apartments of the illuminated one as well as this very servant of him [ie. Mariankouda]. Rest their souls in the bosom of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob, in the shining place, in the place of refreshment, from which pain and gries~ and lamentation have fled away.

Previously known as the Hamdab Dam, it has recently been renamed ‘Merowe’ after a small island, the tinea part of which will be cut through by the structure of the dam itself. Most of the local inhabitants pronounce the name of this island Mirowy. . For various reasons this project was not realized for sixty years. Ever since it came to power in 1989 the present government has considered the dam a project of top Priority because it will create enough hydroelectric power (1250 mg/w) to advelap many sectors of the national economy. After many studies made by expert aie national institutions and companies, the government of the Sudan decided to build a single dam, crossing the island of Merowe, located about 26 km upstream from the pyramids of Nuri. The completion of the project is scheduled for August 2008. The highest water level (reached during flood season) will be about 300 m above sea level. This will result in the inundation of a strip of land, about 170 km upstream of the dam. A lake approximately 4 km wide will be formed immediately behind the dam. This will necessitate the relocation of more than 48,000 people from their homes, The aim of the Merowe Dam Archaeological Salvage Project (MDASP) is to rescue archaeological sites endangered by the construction of this dam (figs 194—5).! A considerable number of archaeological sites will be affected to varying degrees: * Sites which will either be destroyed by the engineering activities at the dam site or covered by the waters of the lake upstream. This will include a strip of land of about 170 km on both banks of the Nile, together with many islands. Sites which will be destroyed by the building of houses and digging of irrigation canals in the resettlement areas. Sites which will be affected by the construction of power transmission lines. Although the monumental sites of the Napatan Region will not be directly affected by these activities, the National Corporation for Antiquities and Museums (NCAM) is concerned about the expected environmental changes. These sites include the famous Pharaonic and Kushite towns and cemeteries at Jebel Barkal, Nuri, Sanam, el-Kurru, Hillat el-Arab, the Post-Meroitic tumuli of ez-Zuma and Tangqasi, the Christian monastery of el-Ghazali, and the later strongholds at Merowe East, Kagabi, el-Datti, and possibly other sites located further downstream. --- Page 310 ---",30149,sudan-ancient-treasures-images/30149.png,True,

Numerous lumps were found in this level. The iron oxides were exploited from the Nubian sand- stone bedrock in the site's vicinity and trans- ported to it as lumps of variable dimensions. Here, four lumps are exhibited representing various stages of the manufacturing process. These include an unworked piece of yellow iron oxide, a fragment of yellow ochre showing chipping on its sides and rubbing striations on one of its faces, a red ochre with | | i i | i i i 9.10, 11 rubbing striations and a completely smoothed red ochre fragment, created as a result of intensive rubbing. It is unknown what the pigments were used for, but it seems likely that it was, at least on occasion, in the context of symbolic activi- ties. As in other African Middle Palaeolithic sites, yellow pigment lumps are by far the most numerous which seems to indicate a preference for yellow colours.

On top of its natural gloss, resulting from ae transportation in the Nile river bed, one of its faces shows a very intensive polish. This polish, with parallel striations, is undoubtedly the result of the pebble’s use by humans. Chert pebbles showing an association of clearly contrasting colours, such as red and black in this case, are extremely rare in the natural gravel deposits which were exposed at the site during the early Middle Palaeolithic occupation. Nevertheless they occur quite frequently in Level 6 and it is, therefore, likely that they were deliberately selected from the wider environment. As some of them show adhering particles of ochre, their use seems to be related to pigment processing. This, in turn, suggests that pigment processing may have had ritual connotations.

One of the prehistoric settlements which line the right bank of the Nile, about 40 km north of Khartoum, it was the first such site to be excavated after A.J. Arkell’s archaeological discoveries in the area. It revealed a cul- ture similar to that of the Khartoum Hospital site? and was carbon-14 dated to c. 5700 sc. The site consisted of an extensive dwelling area, with abundant settlement remains such as artefacts and food residues, scattered in a 600 mm-thick archaeo- logical deposit. Human burials were found in all test pits, as in all other such sites, which suggests that burials in these cultures were commonly associated with the dwellings. Chronologically on the borderline between the Palaeolithic and Neolithic, this culture is characterized by peculiar technological achievements, which include its pottery production and a complex settle- ment and territorial occupation. The earliest pottery is, quite unexpectedly, of very high technical quality (thin-walled, well fired) and aesthetic appearance (intensively and finely decorated with impressed motifs), The decoration covers the whole surface, from the rim to the round bottom, on most of the pots. The motifs, which vary according to the technique and tool used, are either widely spaced or packed, or arranged in bands, with different designs sometimes alternated. Implements include a wide range of bone artefacts (harpoons, perforators and handles), grind- ing stones and a large number of geometric microliths to be hafted into composite tools. Hunting and fishing were the main strategies for food procurement, as is attested by the tools and bone waste. Human bone pathology and chemistry suggest that the Saggai people consumed fish, molluscs and meat. Sedentariness and pottery-making in non-food pro- ducing societies are among the most notable peculiari- ties of African prehistory. The combined presence at Saggai of pottery and grinding equipment, which are quite common throughout the Sahara and Sudan well before the adoption of any form of food production, should not be taken as an argument for the presence of agriculture. The absence of botanical evidence and low ecological probability speak against it. The earliest post- Palaeolithic hunter-gatherers were defined in Sudan as Mesolithic because of their sedentary sites which lay close to the river, and because of their heavy depen- dence on riverine resources, as shown by food residues. These cultures, dated in this area to between c. 6000 and 4100 sc, were basically settled along the Nile but used the hinterland as a complementary hunting terri- tory as well as a supply area for raw material for their grinding equipment. Besides this rather ordinary site catchment, however, these groups were recently dis- covered to have established an exceptionally complex settlement pattern in the area. This system comprised functionally specialized settlements distributed over a vast territory, which extended from the Nile to at least",31186,sudan-ancient-treasures-images/3185_31187_31186.png,False,sudan-ancient-treasures-images/3185_31187_31186.png

Most were carved out of ostrich eggshell fragments which were perforated with a lithic borer and strung together before being shaped into discs. Some, which are not, however, distinguishable with the naked eye, were made of fine-grained limestone. Such beads were frequently found in Mesolithic deposits, though never in specific funerary contexts, which suggests that they were used in daily life.

This example has a long butt. Harpoons, with up to four barbs on one side only, have been found at other Mesolithic sites, such as Khartoum Hospital (Arkell 1949a, 75).

The bracelets have been made from the tooth cut longitudinally rather than being cut as a cross section. They were then perforated and partially polished. This type of bracelet is found both in adult and infant graves. These thick examples were found by the wrists of the skeleton, but the finer pieces could also be worn at the biceps. Ivory bracelets are common in burials along the Nile Valley.

The heads are small and the hair, here represented by a pecked cap, is always shown. The navel is always depicted, although the reason for this is unknown. Incised grooves around the neck undoubtedly represent necklaces (one example also shows two small holes, by the location of the arms that were intended to hold in place a string of ostrich eggshell beads); those at the level of the pelvis seem to correspond to tattoos or to decorated clothes, Figurines of this form are the most fre- quent type found at el-Kadada, although they are not found elsewhere in Nubia.

Whilst always in a funerary environ- ment, they have been found in different contexts — in graves of children, women and men, some rich in grave goods, though occa- sionally they were the only such object in the grave. The only certainty is that the schemati- zation of the human body is not due to a lack of skill of the artist (one figurine is made in such a realistic fashion that it has formed the basis of an anatomic-physiological lecture). but to the desire to produce a symbolic repre- sentation of it.

The harpoons pre- sent a flat oval cross section and have three or four barbs, Harpoons were used for hunting aquatic game such as hippopotamus and crocodile (Kuper 1988, 136), and for fishing. They are widespread on sites of the early pottery horizon throughout the Sahara (see Sutton 1974), thus their rare occurrence in the Southern Libyan Desert is surprising. Harpoons found on sites of the Early Khar- toum Horizon in Sudan are usually unilater- ally barbed (e.g. Saggai: Zarattini 1983, 246; Khartoum Hospital: Arkell 1949a, 75: Atbara Region: Haaland 1995, 130).

The wide range of forms includes small lunates, triangular and tanged types as well as numerous transitional forms (Keding 1993, fig. 2). The sharp sides were the cutting edges of the arrowheads, while the retouched sides guaranteed firm hafting in wooden shafts. They are made of fine-grained stone, mainly chalcedony and jasper. These raw materials are found in the adjacent moun- tainous areas and thus indicate middle- distance transportation or trade with people from Jebel Tageru to the south, Jebel Rahib to the east, or the Ennedi Hills to the west. Transverse arrowheads were usually used for weapons, However, in the context of the cattle-keeping groups of the Leiterband Horizon, where remains of hunted animals are almost never found, they may also have been used to pierce the veins of the animals to extract blood, Today, the ‘bleeding’ of cattle is a widespread practice among cattle keepers in East Africa where blood is sometimes an important nutritional supplement (Dahl and Hjort 1976, 172 ff; Evans-Pritchard 1937,",31301,sudan-ancient-treasures-images/31301.png,True,

One axe has a sharpened and partly polished cutting edge, while the other is rounded for use as a hammer. They are made of a greenish, fine-grained, homoge- nous stone (trachyte). Chips on the edges and necks are the result of being used on hard material. Ground axes of the Darfur type are a spe- cial feature of Leiterband assemblages (Kuper 1981, fig. 4.3). They were probably primarily used for woodworking, but their function as prestige items cannot be excluded. Their dis- tribution is concentrated in the Wadi Howar region and the south-eastern Sahara (Keding 1997a, 192-5; Kuper 1981, 273).

The red-brown colour, thin walls, sand-tempered matrix, simple rounded rim and globular shape fit well into the usual spectrum of Leiterband pottery, Decoration sometimes covers the entire body of the vessel. The rim zone is decorated with a wavy band consisting of opposed rounded impres- sions that are typical of the Leiterband Hori- zon. Body and base are covered with narrow impressed Leiterband patterns, interrupted by two long polished triangular zones. Each tri- angle is embellished by a single rosette made of Leiterband ornaments. A similar rosette decorates the centre of the rounded base. The polished surface of the vessel, as well as the more varied and complex arrangement of the decoration, suggests that the pot had more than a purely utilitarian purpose. Like most of the well-preserved pottery fragments of the Leiterband Horizon, it was found in an eroded pit together with numerous cattle bones. This unusual association, found on some sites in the Wadi Howar region, may have had a ritual significance (Keding 1997a, 204-40).

The very homogenous thin- walled ware is of high quality. It is character- ized by careful surface treatment, an almost exclusively inorganic temper consisting mainly of sand, and it was constructed using the coil technique. The round-bottomed egg- shape with no neck restriction and a non- modelled rim is a characteristic pot form of this period, As in this case, many Leiterband pots were decorated from rim to base. Typi- cal patterns are Leiterband ornaments, impressed in the rocker-stamp technique with a gap-toothed implement and arranged in narrow horizontal bands, While other patterns related to the Leiter- band complex have also been found in the Nile Valley, the distribution of the eponymous decoration of this cultural horizon is restricted to the Wadi Howar region and adjacent areas to the west as far as Mali (Commelin 1983, pl. LIV, 3-7; Keding 1997a, fig. 74). Detailed analysis of the pottery of the Leiterband Horizon suggests a common origin with the Khartoum Neolithic of the Nile Valley, fol- lowed by a more local development which seems to have become more and more orientated towards the western areas (Keding --- Page 62 --- a a 39,40 1998). The people who used the Leiterband pottery were the first cattle herders in this region.

The simple pres- ence of grinding stones on archaeological sites is, however, inconclusive concerning the question of domesticated agriculture, as wild grasses can also be processed. Besides plant processing, grinding equipment can be used for various purposes, for example, to crush colour pigments or for clay processing during pottery production (Schén and Holter 1988, 159).

It was found upside down near a small group of burials. The pot has a curved profile and a pronounced neck. It is thin-walled, finely smoothed, tempered with sand and fibre, and was formed by pinching and drawing. Irregu- larities in the ochre-brown colour of the outer surface are the result of uncontrolled firing conditions, typical of open-field firing. The outer surface has mat impressions from base to belly, a typical feature of Handessi A pottery. The clearly structured decoration is restricted to the rim and the upper part of the vessel, and underlines the composite contours of the pot. The inner rim is decorated with a narrow band of oblique comb impressions running parallel to the rim. On the outer surface, triangles are outlined by comb impressions and filled with densely dotted zig-zags produced by the rocker- stamp technique. Two rows of opposing tri- angles, one on either side of a group of three parallel horizontal lines, give an impression of a large rhombus. Though following the general trend of this period towards geometric decorations on curved-profile vessels, supra-regional parallels to Handessi A pottery are found only in indi- vidual cases.

The other is oval with rounded edges, again with convex faces. Both taper down towards the edges and are made of quartzite, The two faces of these palettes are polished and their extremities present slight traces of percussion, They were found in graves located near the Pre-Kerma settle- ment. The larger one was discovered in the 47 mostly destroyed tomb of an adult. The smaller palette has a much finer finish. It was located in a rich, partially destroyed burial of a woman. Placed near the hands of the body, it was accompanied by two small pebbles used as grinders, and covered some fragments of malachite, used as a pigment. Make-up tablets are known from Neolithic and protohistoric Nubian burials. Examples of metamorphic rock, dating to the fifth millennium nc, have been found at Kadruka, not far from Kerma (Reinold 2000a). The quartzite examples appear to be more recent and are found in the A-Group graves of Lower Nubia (Nordstrom 1972, 120). Occasionally Kerma Ancien graves contain palettes, but these become increasingly rare in this later period (Bonnet 1990a, 200).

Its colour tends towards dark grey on its interior and around the rim, while it is beige on the rest of the exterior. These differences in colour are a result of the type of firing: the jar will have been placed upside down in an open-air fire. The decora- tion, restricted to the rim, is composed of parallel incisions, occasionally arranged in a chevron pattern. Of the 285 excavated pits in the Pre-Kerma settlement, only two contained jars. These will have been used for food stor- age, probably of cereals. The jar presented here was found upside down, with the open- ing to the bottom of the pit. This position indi- cates that it was probably not in use at the time the place was abandoned. This type of jar has parallels among the A-Group pottery assemblage (Nordstrém 1972, pl. 182).

Round buildings were characteristic of
the architecture of the capital city of
Kerma. In addition to the two deffufas,
the “skyline” was dominated by a
large, hemispherical structure that
probably served as a royal palace (cf.
fig. 19). It was surrounded by smaller
oval huts. This ensemble resembles
quite closely the archetypal image of
the central African settlement and, in
contrast to Egyptian architecture,
introduces completely new perspec-
tives.

This vessel with cover, painted black,
red, and yellow over a white back-
ground, could represent a model of
one of these round shelters. The cover
particularly supports this interpreta-
tion, since it imitates the thatched roof
construction used in such buildings.
The vessel is usually considered to be
an imitation of a woven basket, but
there are no parallels or other archaeo-
logical materials to support this inter-
pretation.

Like the Nubian/Sudanese Neolithic
and the A-Group Culture, the Kerma
Culture defined itself above all by its
ceramics. The technical standard of
manufacturing hard-fired, thin-walled
pottery is equaled by the formal deco-
ration of the vessels. Figural pottery
makes up a separate category, consist-
ing mostly of pitchers, their spouts
decorated with animal heads. This red-
polished, spherical pitcher, with a han-
dle in imitation of rope, has a spout
with the head of a horned animal. This
is probably a goat, to judge from the
form and remains of the broken horns.
A double band is incised around the
neck. On the back is a six-pointed
rosette, perhaps to be understood as
the rear quarters of the animal. The
modeled figure of a striding male has
been added in bold relief to the right
side. He wears a kilt (and a phallus
sheath?), and holds a long staff out in
front of him. He is a shepherd and
leads an animal behind him (difficult to
see because of the lacunae in the
restored vessel). Under the left part of
the rim sits the relief figure of a six-
legged crocodile. An “outline” of the
environment of the Nile Valley is repre-
sented by these figures.

Set on three legs, this spherical vessel is
meant to represent the body of a bird,
This is clear from the addition of a few
modeled elements: wingtips on both
sides and the tail on the back. The
long, diagonally outstretched neck
defines the bird as an ostrich, although
the head is not indicated.

Although leaning on Egyptian models
for its formal composition, this repre-
sentation of a man striding to the right
was certainly not created by an
Egyptian artist, as is evident from the
proportions. The figure holds a bow
and arrows in his left hand and a mace
in his right. A crown with a uraeus ser-
pent imitates the White Crown of
h crown and mace
are emblems of royalty. Since the stela
derives from an area of Buhen that was
primarily inhabited by Kerma peoples
during the second Intermediate
Period, we can assume that the stela

portrays the king of Kerma.

Two large lion figures can be recon-
structed from fragments of blue-
glazed faience tiles that were probably
set into the facade of the Eastern
Deffufa flanking the entrance.
Additional fragments indicate the
presence of other figures, including
bound prisoners and a hippopotamus.
The backs of the tiles show the
impressions of linen or basketry that
was used in their manufacture.
Fragments of cavetto cornices, torus
moldings, and plant motifs most likely
formed the decorative pattern along
the margins.

A diverse world of animals is shown in
these small cut-out figures of ivory or
mica. Mica, a siliceous mineral includ-
ed in flaky layers within hard stones, is
found, among other places, in the
Wadi el-Hudi. While the ivory figures
served as inlays for pieces of furniture,
in particular for beds, the figures cut
out of mica were sewn onto caps and
other textiles. They were often discov-
ered in burials near the head of the
deceased. The selection of mica figures
includes both real animals and mytho-
logical creatures, for example, winged
giraffes, or the Egyptian goddess
Thoueris shown as a composite figure
with hippopotamus head, crocodile
back, and female human torso with
pendulous breasts. These figures are
almost identical to the ivory inlays, and
their similarity to the so-called magical
wands in Egypt suggests that they
served an apotropaic function, and
were intended to ward off evil.

The motif of the raging lion attacking a
desert animal is a favorite metaphor for
the triumph of the Egyptian pharaoh
over the enemies of his kingdom. In this
ax blade from a tomb at Semna it is pos-
sible that the ibex, surprised by the royal
lion from behind, symbolizes the van-
quished Nubians. The piece shows work-
manship of high quality in its overall
composition, as well as in the lion’s mane
and the paralyzed expression of the ibex.

In adherence to Egyptian tradition, the
Kushites included funerary stelae as an
integral part of their burial equipment.
They were either erected before the
west wall of the offering chapel or
interred with the burial itself. The stela
of Queen Tabiry, a queen of King Piy
and daughter of Alara, the first ruler of
Napata, is our earliest example.
Beneath the lunette, in which Tabiry is
shown worshipping Osiris and Isis, nine

“first great king’s wife of the majesty
of Piy,” and the unusual epithet “great

Two bronze legs from a funerary bed
were found in the tomb of a minor
queen of King Shabitko. They were
resting in depressions prepared for
them around a stone coffin bench
which once held the body of the
deceased. The lower portion of this leg
is a square box with gently sloping
sides. On each of these, a wide mold-
ing surrounds the central motif of a
papyrus thicket, reproduced in its clas-
sical hieroglyphic form. Corrosion has
attacked all four sides, where pins of a
different metallic composition, perhaps
nails, have been driven through the
walls. The upper portion of the bed leg
has four sides, is hollow, and widens
toward the top. It terminates in an arc
with square holes piercing all four sides
to take the bedframe.

The upper portion of the bed leg
grows out of the back of a goose,
which nestles down on the box sup-
port. Its feathers were finely chased
after the form was cast. The head and
pointed beak are examples of particu-
larly fine artistic and technical work-
manship.

The significance of this motif lies in
one of the god Amun's many divine
forms. In Egypt from the New
Kingdom on, he is often represented
as a goose. Furthermore, in the
Pyramid Texts of the Old Kingdom, the
deceased utters the desire to ascend to
heaven as a goose. And in New
Kingdom royal tombs, wooden figures
of geese are found among the images
of deities buried with the deceased in
order to accompany him to the next
world.

MORE THAN A CENTURY OF

ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH IN THE SUDAN

SALAH MOHAMMED AHMED

Continent, is also one chest regions in archae-
ological remains. Its location, extending from the south-
ern frontiers of Egypt in the north to the equatorial belt
in the south and from the Red Sea coast in the east to the
African interior in the west, enriches the country with dif-
ferent climates and a variety of ethnic groups and popu-
lations. The Sudan has always played the role of a
“meeting place for different peoples and cultures. In the
past, it was the “meeting ground between the
“Mediterranean world and the heart of Africa. The Nile
-passage has constituted from the earliest times a vital
route through which people, goods, and ideas circulated
between north and south. This fact is clearly reflected in

the modern-day Sudan, a country inhabited by hundreds -

of tribes and ethnic groups with different cultural back-
grounds. However, two main sources of cultural influence
can be noted: the Arab-lslamic world and Central Africa.
The Sudan and its role in the development of the
region's civilization have been of a certain interest to the
outside world since very ancient times. Before the begin-
ning of the modern era of archaeological investigations in
the last century, the country was known in many works by
Greek, Roman, Byzantine, and Arab writers. The Greeks
used the term “Aethiopia” to designate the regions lying
to the south of Egypt, though it clearly did not apply to a
specific ethnic group or a well defined geographical terri-
tory. By using the term, the Greeks were probably referring
to different populations with brown “burnt-faces"" occu-
pying the regions south of the First Cataract. The land of
""Aethiopia” was described in many works of the classical
writers starting from the Sth century 8.c. onward—
Herodotus wrote his description of Meroe about 430 B.c.

Among those who wrote about the Sudan we can men-

tion Diodorus Siculus, Strabo, Dio Cassius, and Pliny.""
To illustrate the relationship between the ancient
Sudan and the Mediterranean world, it is worth men-

sae ticay

tioning two antiquities found in the country. The first one
is a column drum found at Meroe, now preserved in
Liverpool. Some scholars think that the Greek alphabet
inscribed on this drum was used for the education of
Meroitic children. The second object is a Latin inscription
from Musawwarat es-Sufra.2

The period of the region’s conversion to
Christianity, the sixth century a.p., is well documented in
the writing of many church historians. Among these the
works of John of Ephesus are particularly important.3 The
Arab-Islamic invasion of Egypt in a.p. 641 brought Nubia
to the attention of Arab historians. The conversion of the
country to Islam and the establishment of the Funj
Kingdom of Sennar in the sixteenth century marked an
era of a very rich local literature on the political, religious,
and economic conditions in the country.4

This knowledge of the country acquired from clas-
sical and later literature encouraged many travelers to visit
the Sudan and document its monuments during the eigh-
teenth and nineteenth centuries. James Bruce, arriving
from Ethiopia along the Blue Nile in 1722, visited many of
the archaeological sites between Sennar and the Egyptian
frontier. He was the first to identify the ruins of Begraweya
with ancient Meroe. Later on, J.-L. Burckhardt visited the
region and described its peoples and monuments.§

The Turkish governor of Egypt, Muhammad Alli
Pacha, who claimed the independance of Egypt from the
Ottoman Empire, decided to annex the Sudan to his
kingdom. He sent his armies to the country and put an
end to the Funj Kingdom of Sennar in 1821. This inva-
sion marked a very important point in the history of
archaeological research in the Sudan. Various European
adventurers accompanied the army. Interested in archae-
ology, these travelers documented and studied many of
the country’s monuments. The most important of these
pioneers is the Frenchman Ff. Cailliaud, who made
descriptions, plans, and drawings of many of Sudan's

monumental sites.” Among the travellers it is also impor-
tant to mention Linant de Bellefonds,8 Waddington and
Hanbury,? and Hoskins.'9 In the 1830s, the Italian medicial
doctor Ferlini undertook his famous treasure hunt at
Meroe, destroying some of its pyramids. However, the
work of the Prussian expedition under the direction of K.-
R. Lepsius (1842-1844) is considered to be the most
important step toward a scientific handling of the archae-
ological sites of the region.""! This mission carried out a full
scientific documentation of almost all the existing monu-
ments from the frontier of Egypt to the region of
Khartoum in the south. The second half of the last century
constituted a gap in the history of archaeological research
in the Sudan. The political situation in the country during
the Mahadist Revolution (1881-1898) had left the Sudan
in almost complete isolation from the outside world. No
archaeologists or travelers visited the country until its final
reconquest by British and Egyptian armies in 1898.

The present century has witnessed, since its begin-
ning, a considerable development of archaeological
research in Nubia. This is manifested in organized, sys-
tematic archaeological campaigns, the work of many mis-
sions, and a remarkable evolution of the legislative and
administrative institutions of antiquities in the Sudan.

Three systematic archaeological campaigns have
been organized in Nubia since the beginning of this cen-
tury. These were the result of the building and the sub-
sequent heightening of the Aswan Dam near the First
Cataract and the necessity to rescue the monuments and
the sites then endangered by rising waters.

The Aswan Dam was built between 1898 and
1902. In 1907, the Egyptian government decided to
increase its storage capacity. This decision endangered
both banks of the Nile in the area between the First
Cataract and Wadi es-Sebua. Many important sites and
monuments were going to be covered, forever, by the
rising water of the heightened dam. As a result the first
archaeological campaign was organized (1907-1911) to
rescue the region's antiquities. The first season of the
campaign was directed by G.-A. Reisner, while the sub-
sequent seasons were directed by C.-M. Firth.12

More than forty cemeteries were excavated, in addi-
tion to some fortresses, of which the most irnportant were
those of Ikkur and Kuban. The study and the classification
of the tombs and their grave goods enabled Reisner and his
colleagues to establish a sequence of evolution for the

Nubian cultures. In the absence of a resemblance er
horizons from Egypt, these cultures were given alpha ,
cal designations: A-Group, B-Group, C-Group, and is

to Dal, a few kilometers south of the Second Cataract.

The present century also witnessed a considerable
number of individual archaeological expeditions and a
remarkable development of the legislative and adminis-
trative organisms of archaeology in the Sudan. With the
end of the Mahadist Revolution and the Anglo-Egyptian
colonization of the Sudan in 1898, the country became
accessible to archaeologists, who started roaming the
region to study its sites and monuments.

The British administration (1898-1956) encour-
aged scientists to come to the Sudan, and from the early
years of the century appointed an official to look after
the antiquities of the country. At the beginning this task
was often given to the Director of Education or one of
his assistants, who did the job alongside his primary
occupation. However, a permanent post, commissioner
for archaeology, was created in 1939 and A.-J. Arkell
was the first appointment. The British administration
issued the first law controlling archaeological activity in
1905. This law developed into the “Antiquities
Ordinance” which was amended in 1952 and has
remained in force to the present day.

The Antiquities Service, now the National
Corporation for Antiquities and Museums (NCAM), is
presently a department of the Ministry of Environment
and Tourism. It is the government's organ responsible for
the excavation, protection, and exhibition of Sudan's cul-
tural heritage. It consists of three main departments:
Fieldwork, Restoration, and Museums. In addition to
uncovering and preserving sites and monuments, the
NCAM is very active in the field of exhibiting the mate-
rial culture of the Sudan's rich heritage. At the present

day, the department runs the following museums:

1, The Sudan National Museum, opened in Khartoum in 1972.
An archaeological museum, it exhibits monuments and objects repre-
senting the cultural development of the country from prehistoric times
to the Islamic period.

2. The Khalifa House Museum at Omdurman. This was the resi-
dence of the successor of the Mahadi (1885-1898). It has been trans-
formed into a museum exhibiting objects related to the Mahadist
Revolution and the Anglo-Egyptian administration.

(Voyages, pl. XXXVI; photograph: M. Biising)

3. The Ethnographical Museum in Khartoum. It exhibits ethno-
graphical objects of the different tribes and ethnic groups of the country.

4. The Museum of Shaikan at El-Obied. This is a regional museum
in the capital of the state of Kordofan (western Sudan). It exhibits
archaeological objects from the different periods of the country’s history,
together with ethnographical material.

5. The Sultan Ali Dinar Palace Museum. This is the residence of
the Sultan Ali Dinar, one of the commanders of the Mahadist Revolution
who escaped the Battle of Omdurman (1898) and established a small
kingdom in western Sudan which survived until 1916. The palace lies in
the town of El-Fasher, the capital of Darfour (western Sudan). The
museum exhibits objects of this period in addition to archaeological
material illustrating the different phases of the history of the Sudan.

Other museums are planned at Gebel Barkal,
Meroe, and elsewhere.

The official awareness of the importance of archae-
ology is not only manifested in the development of the leg-

islative and administrative fields and the opening of muse-
ums, but can be also noticed in the field of education. In the
eatly 1960s, a Department of Archaeology was created
within the Faculty of Arts at the University of Khartoum.
Another Faculty of Heritage and Archeology was estab-
lished at Kereima, near Gebel Barkal, in 1992. At first, this
was a branch of the Wadi el-Neel (Nile Valley) University cen-
tred at El-Damer. Now it has been transformed into a
Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences and linked to the newly
established University of Dongola. Another Department of
Archaeology is also planned within the University of Shendi.
Since its establishment at the beginning of the
century, the Antiquities Service has followed a clear pol-
icy of encouraging archaeological missions to uncover
the hidden and buried history of the country. In the north
of the country and concurrent with the first Nubian
archaeological campaign (1907-1911), the expedition of
the University of Pennsylvania excavated the sites of
Ereika (1907),!5 Karanog, and Shablul.16 At the same
time, G. S. Mileham carried out a survey of churches in
Lower Nubia.17 Later on, Steindorff, at the head of the
Ernst von Sieglin Expedition of Leipzig, worked at Aniba

limited excavations at Gebel Barkal and Meroe. In 1907,
he published his book The Egyptian Sudan. . . .7""
Archaeological activity in the central Sudan also includes
the tours and reports of J.-W. Crowfoot? and P. D. Scott-
Moncrieff.23 In 1909, J. Garstang carried out the first
extensive excavations at Meroe,24 and Sir H. Wellcome
excavated the site of Gebel Moya in the period
1911-14.25 Under the direction of Griffith, the Oxford
Expedition in Nubia excavated at Faras (1910-1 2).26
Later on they excavated the temple of Taharga, the
Napatan cemetery, and a small part of the Napatan town
of Sanam Abu Dom.2? Finally they worked on the temple
complex of Kawa.28

The coming of G.-A. Reisner, who directed the
first season of the first archaeological campaign of Nubia
(1907-8), at the head of the expedition of Harvard
University and the Museum of Fine Arts of Boston
marked a very important phase of the study of the his-
tory of the Sudan. In the period from 1913 to 1932, this
mission excavated at the site of Kerma south of the Third
Cataract; the temples and pyramids of Gebel Barkal, the
royal cemeteries of Nuri, Kurru, and Meroe; and a group
of Egyptian fortresses near the Second Cataract.

At Kerma, Reisner brought to light one of Africa's
most ancient kingdoms.29 Although most of the antiqui-
ties on the site were wrongly attributed to the Egyptian
occupants of the Middle Kingdom, the material yielded by
the site and the standard of the documentation were
essential for the later studies of this civilization, which is
now considered as a purely Nubian achievement. The
study of the royal tombs at Kurru,30 Nuri,3? Gebel Barkal,32
and Meroe32 enabled Reisner to reconstruct Kushite his-
tory. A royal succession from the ninth century B.c. to the
fourth century A.o. was then worked out. In the period
1928-32, the mission excavated the Egyptian fortresses of
Shelfak, Uronarti, Mirgissa, Semna, and Kumma.*4

Little archaeological work was undertaken in the
1930s and 1940s. The economic crisis and the Second
World War were largely responsible for this gap in the
history of archaeological research in the region. We have
already mentioned the second heightening of the Aswan
Dam and the archaeological salvage campaign
(1929-1934) organized to rescue the monuments of
Nubia, then endangered by the rising water of the lake
formed in front of the dam. At the same time, U.
Monneret de Villard completed the survey of the Lower

Nubian churches started by Mileham at the beginning of
the century.2> A very important work realized during the
1940s is considered to be the foundation for prehistoric
studies in the Sudan. This was A. J. Arkell's excavations
at the Paleolithic site of Khor Abu Anga,3® the Mesolithic
site of Khartoum,3”? and the Neolithic site of Esh-
Shaheinab.38 At the same time O. H. Myers from the
Gordon Memorial College of Khartoum conducted his
excavations at the prehistoric site of Abka.39
Considerable archaeological research was con-
ducted in the years following the Second World War up
to the present day. It is important to mention here the
work conducted by P. L. Shinnie at the monastery of
Ghazali,4° the post-Meroitic tumuli of Tangasi,4! and
Soba East.42 The Sudan Antiquities Service conducted
the excavation of the site of Wad ban Naga under the
direction of J. Vercoutter and Thabit H. Thabit at the end
of the 1950s.43 During almost the same period, the
Humboldt University, Berlin surveyed the Butana region
and undertook excavations at Musawwarat es-Sufra.44
Further work on the prehistory of the Butana was carried
out later on by the University of Texas and the University
of Khartoum.45 In the north, excavations have been con-
ducted at Mirgissa and Sai Island4® by the French
Mission, by the Expedition of M. Schiff-Giorgini at
Soleb,4”7 and by the Foundation Blackmer and the
University of Geneva on Argo Island.48 In the 1960s the
University of Khartoum started, with the University of
Calgary, the excavation of the town site of Meroe,49
under the direction of P. L. Shinnie, who had previously
participated in the activities of the Egypt Exploration
Society in Nubia.5° The creation of the French
Archaeological Unit in the 1970s was a great achieve-
ment that permitted the Sudan Antiquities Service to
conduct rescue work in different parts of the country.
Nowadays, the National Corporation — for
Antiquities and Museums (NCAM) is cooperating with
more than twenty missions conducting field researches
in different parts of the country. The following sites and
regions are presently under investigation:
Sai Island (The French Archaeological Mission of the Island of Sai),
Sadeinga (Sadeinga Archaeological Unit, France), Soleb (IFAO, France),
the Third Cataract Region (University of Khartoum and University of
Newcastle), Kerma (University of Geneva), Kadruka (The French Section
of the NCAM), Gism Arbaa (University of Lille), Kawa-Khandag (The
Sudan Archaeological Research Society [SARS], England), Old Dongola

(University of Warsaw), Latti Basin (Royal Ontario Museum), Gebel
Barkal (University of Rome; Museum of Fine Arts, Boston; and the Clos

Foundation, Spain), El Arab (University of Cassino, Italy and the
NCAM), Hamdab (Museum of Gdansk, Poland), Begrawey-Atbara
region (SARS, England), Meroe (University of Khartoum and Humboldt
University), Musawwarat es-Sufra (Humboldt University), Naga (the
Egyptian Museum of Berlin), Geili (The University of Rome), Kadero
(Museum of Poznan, Poland), the region of the right bank of the Blue
Nile (University of Madrid), Kassala and the Gash Delta (University of
Naples), the eastern desert (The Eastern Desert Research Center, Italy),
and the Libyan desert (University of Cologne).

From the above-mentioned survey of archaeologi-
cal investigations in the Sudan, we note the concentration
of such activity on the banks of the Nile. However, scien-
tific work is currently being conducted in new areas in the
eastern Sudan, along the Red Sea coast, in the Gash Delta,
and in the eastern desert. Only brief fieldwork had previ-
ously been undertaken in this region by the Universities ot
Lyon and Khartoum. Very little work has been undertaken
in the west and south of the country; the only investiga-
tions, both realized in the 1980s, were by the University of
Hamburg at Gebel Marra in Darfour and by the British
Institute in East Africa (Nairobi) in the southern Sudan.

The Fieldwork Section of the NCAM is active in con-
ducting salvage operations, alone or with foreign missions,
to rescue the cultural heritage of the country which is more
and more endangered by the rapid economic and social
development of the Sudan. The corporation is reviving its
restoration project for the pyramids of Meroe with the
technical and scientific help of Dr. F. Hinkel. A similar pro-
ject for the protection and restoration of the port of Suakin
on the Red Sea is being prepared. The NCAM welcomes all
efforts of individuals and institutions to participate in the
uncovering, protection, and exhibition of the Sudan's cul-
tural heritage, which is truly the heritage of all mankind.

6,000 YEARS AGO

REMARKS ON THE PREHISTORY OF THE SUDAN

JAcQues REINOLD & LECH KRZYZANIAK

he study of Sudanese prehistory is still in its infancy.

After rather timid beginnings during the Second
World War, prehistoric investigations did not gather
momentum until the 1960s, as a result of the
international campaign for the salvation of Nubian
monuments. Nevertheless, many regions of the vast
territory of the Sudan, whose surface area corresponds
to a quarter of the entire European continent, remain to
this day terra incognita. It would be presumptuous to
claim that the outlines of individual cultures and their
chronologies are settled beyond dispute.

The Paleolithic

Located west of the East African rift valley and
thought to be the birthplace of humanity, the Sudan
plays a direct role in the earliest stages of human
evolution, an “East Side Story,” as it is sometimes called.
The first traces of humanity probably do not extend back
further than about 300,000 years. There are hand-axes
of flint from a slightly differentiated early Acheulean era.
This was followed during a moister period about 70,000
years ago by the middle Paleolithic, giving rise to the
cultures known to specialists as the Levallois and
Mousterian. Hunting and fishing were the primary
sources of survival, and aurochs were among the animals
hunted. The late Paleolithic comes to a close around
40,000 s.r. with characteristic types of stone blades and
microliths, small flint implements. The cool, dry climate
of this era concentrated human activity in the river
valleys, as is evident from the finds at sites along the
Atbara and the Blue Nile. Whether the White Nile joined
with the Blue Nile near modern Khartoum during this dry
phase remains doubtful.

From this period until about 10,000 years ago, an
increasing differentiation between _ individual
Epipaleolithic cultural spheres sets in. The stone tools
display numerous similarities to cultures in the Maghreb,

the Levant, and central Africa. Evidence of well-
developed fishing techniques is also noteworthy.

A fundamental shift in climatic conditions
occurred in the eighth millennium s.c., giving rise on
both sides of the Nile Valley to a steppe landscape. The
Wadi Howar in northwest Sudan became a succession of
rivers and lakes. At this time, the present climate of the
southern Sudan stretched some five hundred kilometers
farther north, allowing human habitation in what are
now desert zones, partially in stable settlements along
river courses and partially in seasonally occupied camps.
In the eighth millennium s.c., sites in Khartoum
(Khartoum Hospital) and near the Sixth Cataract (Saqqai)
present clues for the first developmental phases of
ceramics, for which there is no corresponding evidence
at such an early age in the Egyptian Nile Valley. Fishing,
hunting, and the gathering of plants and fruits were the
means of survival in this moist environment. The thin-
walled, partially large-format pottery is primarily
decorated with wavy lines, to which dotted patterns
were later added. This decoration is found much earlier
throughout the entire south Saharan region, from
Mauritania to the East African lakes. Based on the dating
of the most recent discoveries in the central Sudan,
however, the assumption that we are dealing here with
a homogenous cultural zone cannot be confirmed.

The Neolithic Revolution

Since the more recent excavation results from
both the western and eastern Sudan are only partially
accessible in incomplete reports, our overview of
developments in the fifth and fourth millennia §.c. will
have to concentrate primarily on the two regions that
have traditionally been studied most intensively: the
central Sudan, from Atbara to about a hundred
kilometers south of Khartoum, and Nubia from the

Despite the minute scale of this figure
of Isis with the Horus child on her lap,
the workmanship is rich in detail. The
sides of the throne display woven pat-
terns and the traditional motif of the
unification of the Two Lands. The god-
dess wears anklets and armbands in
addition to a close-fitting dress and

North of the first pylon of the Great
Amun Temple at Gebel Barkal, a statue
cache was excavated, producing many
discarded Statues that had once
belonged to the temple's inventory.
Among them was this very dynamic
image of King Tanutamani, broken into
several fragments and _ still headless
today. In its formal composition, the
piece follows the traditional Egyptian
Pattern of the Standing/striding figure,
combining repose and movement or,
as Thomas Mann so masterfully put it,
“stationary in motion, and mobile in
Stasis,”

Stylistically, the statue is an excellent
€xample of Kushite art, with its wide
shoulders and muscular modeling in
the long legs. The iconography also
displays Kushite elements, such as the
three ram's heads (later removed)
hanging from a cord around the neck.
Gilding was originally added to the
unpolished surface areas of the
bracelet and sandals, The Egyptian
inscriptions on the base and back pillar
name Tanutamani, “beloved of Amun

of Napata,” the last Kushite ruler to
rule over Egypt,

The iconography of the Kushite royal
statues provides the context for this
typically Kushite form of amulet. The
ram’‘s head was worn at the breast,
hanging from a cord around the neck.
In this example, it is noteworthy that
the sun on top of the uraeus serpent is
not a disk but a globe.

The classic sphinx form, consisting of a
lion’s body with human head and royal
headdress, is foreign to the art of
Napata. There the preference is for the
variant with a mane (attested several
times for Tahargo), or a sphinx with
human arms and hands, as we have
seen above on the sphinx of
Shepenwepet (cat. 168). The sphinx of
Senkamanisken, discovered in the stat-
ue cache of the great Amun Temple,
wears the royal headdress with double
uraeus and surmounted by the Double
Crown. The latter has lost its original
significance as a crown of Upper and
Lower Egypt, becoming a symbol of
royal dignity.

The transition from the front paws of a
lion to human arms seems to occur at
the elbows. The boldly stylized muscu-
lature of the upper arms is apparently
still part of the lion; similar deep
grooves indicating muscles are visible
On the hind legs.

In its human hands the sphinx holds a
Conical vessel inscribed with the ruler’s
names in cartouches. As with the
standing statue of King Senkama-
nisken (cat. 229), the face here is
uNcompromisingly “African.”

This just under life-size statue of the
wife of King Senkamanisken is one of
the great artistic masterpieces of the
kingdom of Napata. It absorbs an
ancient Egyptian statue type and inte-
grates it completely into an original
stylistic concept; one might consider by
way of analogy the relationship of a
Greek kuros to its formal predecessor
in the Egyptian striding figure.

The slightly striding pose of the left
foot, the upraised left hand under the
breast, and the right arm hugging the
body are all formal elements of grace-
ful female statuary of the New
Kingdom. They are adopted and
extended in the images of so-called
divine votaresses of the Twenty-fifth
Dynasty. This type forms the frame-
work of Amanimalel’s statue, around
which the corpulent volumes of the
figure are developed. The full thighs
and hips, the firm breasts above the
very high waist, and two delineated
folds gently hinting at stomach model-
ing all appear naked, but are actually
wrapped in a close-fitting garment.
The seam, drawn and partially red,
runs from the left shoulder under the
right armpit, leaving the right breast
free, and is also visible over the feet
and wrists. A vertical line from the left
foot over the leg to the left breast indi-
cates the garment's fringe.

The rough state of the surface does
not indicate an unfinished condition,
but rather serves as a coarse base for
the addition of a colorful layer, proba-

THE KINGDOM OF

bly of silver. This is revealed by the fact
that the body parts not covered by the
dress—the hands and feet—do indeed
show a finely polished surface. The
sandal straps were probably gilded.

In her left hand Amanimalel holds a
small seated figure of a child with
Double Crown and sidelock, most like-
ly representing Harpocrates, or “Horus
the child.” In her right hand she holds
an aegis with a menit. The queen is
designated on the back pillar as
“beloved of Amun of Napata, who
resides in the sacred mountain.” An
artistic vision of womanhood personi-
fied, which began with the idols of the
Neolithic and was developed further in
the clay figurines of the A-Group and
C-Group, reaches it culmination in this
statue of the fullest maturity.

With 1,277 shabtis, King Senkama-
nisken exceeded by far the number of
shabtis placed not far from his pyramid
in the tomb of his grandfather Tahargo
(cats. 201-220). In size and quality,
however, they must take second place
behind the large-format examples in
different stones prepared by the earlier
king. One of the five groups of
Senkamanisken’s shabtis, each of
which differs in material and iconogra-
phy, is made of light green faience and
lacks all royal attributes. The tripartite
wig is not only the standard hairstyle
for shabtis, but for the deceased in
general.

The second group of shabtis of
Senkamanisken portrays him with royal
headgear. Over the brow is the double

The serpentine stone used is also a
material worthy of royalty. While
Egyptian shabtis very rarely bear indi-

Tahargo’s and Senkamanisken’s shabtis
are clearly individually distinct.

CYLINDER SHEATHS

In nine royal tombs at Nuri the excava-
tors found cylinder sheaths of precious
metals whose function remains a mys-
tery. In Aspelta’s tomb alone fifteen
examples were unearthed. One sheath
was found at Meroe (Beg. S 85).

The sheaths are assembled from two
pieces: a lower cylinder, sealed at the
base with a round disk, and a shorter
open cylinder placed over an internal
sleeve on the lower piece. On the gild-
ed silver sheet there is sometimes addi-
tional decoration in applied gilded,
silver, or gold wire, or granulated gold
bands; inlays in semi-precious stones
are attested in one example (cat. 258).
The wide range of quality reveals that
a variety of goldsmiths, certainly local,
were at work here. The rich icono-
graphic variations are chased and

sometimes modeled by repoussé.

Beneath a star-filled hieroglyph for
“heaven,” the finely chased gold sheet
shows at left the falcon-headed god Ra
with sun-disk, offering the hieroglyphs
for “life” and “stability” in his right
hand to King Amaniastabarqa at right,
whose name appears in the cartouche.
The latter wears the “Kushite cap”
with double uraeus and diadem, as
well as the royal ram’s-head neck orna-
ment, a broad collar, armlets, bra-
celets, and crossed bands on his
forearms. Beneath the triangular cen-
tral tab of his kilt is a calf-length gar-
ment with a fringed seam through
which his legs are visible. The king's
sandals are bowed at the toes. Above
him hovers the sun-disk with uraeus
and outspread wings forming a right
angle. King and god each extend a
hand to the other, while the king's left
hand is raised to the god in a gesture
of recitation. The reciprocal, interde-
pendent relationship between the god
and the king, and their close coopera-
tion, secure the foundations of world
order.

Mirrors with decorated figural handles
are known from the reigns of Shabako

mirror presents the highpoint of these
examples of the goldsmith’s craft. The
slightly oval bronze disk was polished
on both sides. Set into a sickle-shaped
support of silver representing a Cres
cent moon, the disk becomes an image
of the moon. The mirror’s handle takes
the form of a column with a papyrus
capital. Four sculptured deities stand
with their backs to the column.
Aligned with the front and back are
Amun in human form and the falcon-
headed Khons with crescent moon. On
the sides, beneath the sickle-shaped
support, stand the goddesses Mut,

NAPA} AND MEROE

with Double Crown, and Hathor, with
cow's horns. Between the capital and
the mirror’s disk is an abacus with the
name of Nastasen on each of its four
sides. The abacus mediates between
the realm of the earth, symbolized by
the papyrus, and that of heaven,
expressed by the lunar motif of the
mirror's disk.

Surrounding a column with  three-
dimensional figures is a concept for-
eign to Egyptian art but attested
several times in Meroitic architecture,
for example in the great complex of
Musawwarat es-Sufra.

One of the most important discoveries
for the art history of the Sudan in
recent decades was made by a Swiss
expedition to Tago, on the island of
Argo, led by Charles Maystre. In
January, 1974, a gilded bronze statue
came to light in a small pit within the
court of the great temple. Apparently
hidden there, this piece is not only the
largest metal sculpture of the Sudan,
but it also reveals a previously
unknown dimension of Napatan and
Meroitic art. Among its extraordinary
features are the unusually lively expres-
sion created by the inlaid eyes, and the
lifelike sense of motion.

The male figure strides forward with
left arm gently extended before the
body and hand below the waist. The
right forearm reaches into free space.
The freedom of motion and resulting
dynamic effect is allowed by the use of
metal, which eliminates any need for
supporting structures for the arms. The
pose of the left arm may be explained
by a minor iconographic detail. A
thumb ring is shown on the right
thumb (cf. cat. 271), part of the equip-
ment often worn by archers. From this
we can discern that the left hand held
a bow. The forearm guard on the left
arm is also part of the archer’s accou-
trements.

This archer is a king. The Kushite cap
with double uraeus and diadem, the
cord necklace with three ram’s head
amulets, and the kilt are all royal

THE KINGDOM OF

attributes. A broad collar, earrings, and
upper armbands complete the jewelry,
and the figure wears sandals.

A layer of plaster was added to the
metal surface, which was roughened
with punches. Along with the differen-
tiated surface modeling, the plaster
served as a ground for the gilding that
covered the entire body, giving the
impression that the statue was made
of solid gold.

The statue was probably buried toward
the end of the pre-Christian era, per-
haps to protect it from enemy invasion.
By this time it had apparently already
lost a significant portion of its gilding,
for its date of manufacture was con-
siderably earlier. Stylistically, the figure
dates to c. 200 B.c., corresponding
directly with its stocky, extremely pow-
erful proportions to the tradition
favored by Napatan sculpture. The
facial features—especially the small,
pouting mouth—find their closest par-
allels in the reliefs of the precisely
dated Lion Temple of Musawwarat es-
Sufra.

The existence of this figure, found at
Tabo, far from the religious and politi-
cal centers, suggests that an equally
costly statue inventory once belonged
to the temples of Napata or the new
capital city of Meroe. But as the sort of
portable articles particularly favored by
temple thieves, such statues have not
survived the millennia.

Since the very beginnings of Egyptian
history, a diverse symbolic repertory for
representing the destruction of ene-
mies was an integral part of the reign-
ing king's ideology. Egypt's foes were
separated into three groups: Asiatics,
Libyans, and Nubians. With the
Nubians’ adoption of numerous motifs
from Egyptian art, this pictorial sym-
bolism finds its way into royal repre-
sentations of Napatan and Meroitic
art. From being enemy of a constantly
triumphant pharaoh, the Nubian ruler
has now risen to the position of king
himself. In Kushite temple reliefs, long
rows of enemies taken prisoner by the
king are sometimes modeled directly
upon Egyptian reliefs of the New
Kingdom. The temple of Amenhotep Ill
at Soleb is a good example, and many
other models for inspiration were
probably available on the New
Kingdom temple walls at Gebel Barkal.
Anachronisms creep into the scenes
because of this copy work, representa-
tions of peoples who have long since
disappeared from the historical stage.
In many scenes, however, the image of
the enemy is updated, with two
groups receiving particular attention: a
central African or Nilotic type, and an
ethnic group characterized by its coif-
fure of stiffly vertical, middle-length
hair. This second representation seems
to portray the Bedouin Bedja of the
eastern desert, who probably posed a
constant threat.

MEROE

On the basis of the presence of the
hairstyle described above, the prisoner
figure from Tabo belongs to this ethnic
group. He is shown kneeling with his
elbows bound behind the back. The
bonds run diagonally over the
hindquarters to the ankles, tying the
body up like a package. The feet are
crushed beneath the shins. The head
leans horizontally backward, and a
hole is drilled through the neck
between the collarbones, going down
to the base of the statue

Two reliefs on the back of the pylon of
the Lion temple at Naga (see fig. 43,
p. 266) provide the explanation for this
detail. A long, sharp lance has been
driven into the body of a bound pris-
oner shown in identical pose, and the
lion-god Apedemak sits upon it. The

274

statue proves that this motif was not
simply invented for relief representa-
tions but also formed Part of the deco-
rative program for temples, executed
in brutal three-dimensional realism.

KARL-HEINZ PRIESE

= or several millennia the high cultures of Nubia did
without a written form of their language, even
though they were probably well aware from their close
contact with Egypt of the diverse possibilities and uses of
writing. Except for personal names and place-names, no
attempts to write the Nubian language with Egyptian
hieroglyphs are known. Only in the second century B.c.
do inscribed monuments appear in the Meroitic region
displaying the language of the inhabitants in their own
script.

Meroitic is written by means of a “hieroglyphic”
and a “cursive” script; both contain a selection of
Egyptian hieroglyphic and demotic signs. The writing sys-
tem also derives from one of those already in use in
Egyptian texts of the kingdom of Napata for the writing
of non-Egyptian words. As evidence to suggest that such
a system might be used for the composition of entire
texts, we have from Egypt the example of a papyrus of
the Persian period with Aramaic texts in demotic script.
After the elimination of superfluous elements, such as
duplicate signs and determinatives, in the context of an
apparently well-conceived “reform,” the Meroitic writing
system (fig. 42) possessed fifteen consonantal signs, four
syllabic signs (for ne, se, te and to), and four vowel signs,
of which two designate the vowels i and o/u respective-
ly, one has an e or vowel-less value and one an initial e.
In medial position, a is not expressed by a particular sign,
although it is unclear if a consonantal sign without a fol-
lowing vowel sign must always be read as consonant
plus a. The similarity to the ancient Persian writing sys-
tem is noteworthy, although this need not indicate any
common dependence of “invention.” Between the
words, and even between grammatical elements, stands
a word divider; like the numerical signs, this is of
Egyptian origin.

Inscribed Meroitic monuments include a number
of royal texts (the oldest on a stela of King Taneyidamani

253

MEROITIC WRITING AND LANGUAGE

from around 100 8.c.); others are captions beside people
and deities in the wall scenes of pyramid chapels and
temples, as well as a great number of mortuary texts on
stelae and offering stones. There are also “pilgrim
inscriptions” on temple walls. Inscriptions carved in stone
(cat. 284) are also written primarily in cursive script, but
the form of their signs and their development clearly
show that this script was mostly intended for texts on
Papyrus and potsherds, of which only a few examples are
known. In addition to its use in religious contexts,
Meroitic was without doubt also the written language of
both the administration and of daily life.

The variety of preserved inscribed monuments is
SO great that we can assume both knowledge and use of
writing for a significant portion of the population. Since
the decipherment of the writing system by F. LI. Griffith
at the beginning of the twentieth century, a comprehen-
sive body of source material is now at hand for the
Meroitic Period of the kingdom. Its value, however, is
certainly weakened by the fact that the texts can be
read, but not translated. A few basic rules of the linguis-
tic structure are recognizable, showing that Meroitic
might belong to a group of northern Sudanese lan-
guages to which Nubian is also ascribed. But the chrono-
logical and genetic distance from these languages is sO
great that not much help can be expected by making
comparisons. The meaning of divine and personal
names, place-names, and individual titles can be
grasped, especially in those cases that stem from
Egyptian. Among these are words like annata (“priest”),
plamusa (“leader"" or “general""), and a very few addi-
tional nouns such as ato (""water""), at (“bread”), and
certain kinship terms such as wil (“to be someone's
brother”). The most accessible are the funerary texts,
with their fixed progression of formulae and series of
titles. But it is precisely the long royal inscriptions, in

which narratives of historical events are to be expected,
that elude our every attempt at comprehension.

As a written language, Meroitic outlasted the end
of the state. The latest “historical” inscription belongs to
one of the post-Meroitic Nobade kings of the fourth or
fifth century a.p. (the inscription of Kharamadoye in
Kalabsha). Three Meroitic signs were adopted into the
otherwise Greek script of Old Nubian.

To expect to fill in this dearth of source material
from the kingdom of Kush with texts from contemporary
Egypt is a dim hope. But we could mention here the
Egyptian narratives of King Psametek II from the Twenty-
sixth Dynasty concerning his Nubian campaign of 591 8.c.
To these might be added the demotic graffiti on the walls
of Lower Nubian temples from the second to fourth cen-
turies a.b., which provide interesting glimpses into the

LANGUAGE

relations of the court in Meroe and the Meroitic ruling
class active in Lower Nubia to the cult of Isis in Philae.
An important contribution to our picture of
“Ethiopia” should be expected from Greek and Roman
authors. Fragments of such a picture are provided by
Herodotus; from the reign of Ptolemy II onward, writings
on “Ethiopia” are available, with participants in expeditions
to the south recording their observations. But with the
exception of isolated quotations from the works of Bion of
Soli (third century B.c.), these texts are, of course, all lost.
The same fate befell the works of the Greek geographers,
who were the first to evaluate these treatises for their
descriptions of the world. Only Eratosthenes is worthy of
mention here. Even the authors of the Roman Imperial
Period such as Strabo and Pliny are for our purposes little
more than preservers of an ancient corpus of quotations.

The ram-headed Amun, the most
important deity of the Nubian/
Sudanese Nile Valley, can be traced as
far back as the Kerma Culture. This
remains the representation of choice
for the god in the Meroitic Period as
well, differentiated at the various cult
centers only by his crowns. This granite
figure once wore a separately mounted
crown on top of the low cylindrical
headpiece. The transition from human
body to ram's head is hidden by a tri-
partite wig. The typical horns of Amun
are visible on both sides of the head,
curving in a semicircular fashion
around the ears. The eyes were once
inlaid. The marginally differentiated
modeling of the body makes the previ-
ously suggested Napatan date unlikely;
a creation date during the Meroitic
Period is preferable.

this stela among the very finest exam-

identical ram statues lining the proces-
sional approach to the Amun Temple
at Naga. Six were set up before the
kiosk at the upper end of the ramp,
and the other six between the kiosk
and entrance portal to the temple. One
of the statues was stolen in 1992, but
recovered soon after in the desert
south of Atbara. After being brought
to the Museum in Khartoum, it under-
went restoration, since the right side
had been intentionally damaged.
Before being returned to Naga, where
it will be set up once again in its origi-

efforts by the Berlin Naga Expedition, it
was added to the Khartoum loan
objects for the exhibition.

In Egyptian religious iconography the
monkey is a commonly occurring form
of the god Thoth. This deity appears
frequently in the reliefs of Meroitic
pyramid chapels in the scenes of the
judgment of the dead (shown with an
ibis’s head), but is otherwise relatively
rare in Meroitic iconography. Caution
is perhaps advised in identifying this
monkey sculpture with Thoth since it is
apparently shown with arms
upraised—a pose frequently found on
monkeys associated with and praying
to the sun-god.

The unfinished condition of this sand-
stone figure has led to wide specula-
tion. The trunk-like appendage on the
face may resemble an elephant, and
based on this vague association the
figure has been seen as evidence for
contact between the Meroitic
Kingdom and India. The role of the ele-
phant as Meroitic royal animal is well-
attested (cf. cat. 277), but it does not
appear in religious iconography; more-
over, the trunk is too short to represent
an elephant. All this speculation is
pointless, since the overinterpreted ele-
ment is quite simply the divine beard
which, like the entire figure, is unfin-
ished. An uncarved, unfinished bridge
leaves nose and beard connected. The
form of the crown identifies the figure
as the Meroitic god Sebiumeker
(cf. cat. 298, 300).

This bronze statue from Kawa displays
extraordinary technical and stylistic qual-
ity. Stylistic and iconographical factors
refute a dating alongside the Kushite

The figure shows the god Sebiumeker
(cf. cats. 298, 299) with the character-

(here with the addition of a uraeus)
and divine beard. The costume consists
of a tripartite kilt and a feathered
corselet with shoulder ties. Armlets,
bracelets, a pectoral, and a necklace of
large spherical beads make up the
ostentatious jewelry. A wide double
streamer hangs from the crown down
the neck and back, extending all the
way to the belt. The left hand resting
by the side holds the sign for life
(ankh), while the extended right hand
once grasped a scepter.

Three relief figures are carved almost in
sculpture in the round within a frame,
of which the gently rounded jamb
from a door is visible at the bottom of
the fragment. Each of the two broken
halves of this block shows a torus
molding at its outer edge. The scene
itself is symmetrically composed. In the
center stands a female figure whose
mode of representation solves the
problem of presenting a three-dimen-
sional body in only two dimensions.
This is unattested in Egyptian art, but
recurs on a Stela in Boston (cat. 308).
The upper body (and most likely the
missing head as well) are shown

frontally. From the waist down, the
body, legs, and feet appear in profile,
marching left. Around the shoulders is
a scarf that falls over the right upper
arm. On each side is a goddess turned
toward the central figure and pouring
a libation with one hand while holding
a staff in the other. The motif of a
three-figure representation resembles
the triptychs with Osiris flanked by Isis
and Nephthys. In the place of the god
of resurrection, this fragment shows
the deceased queen. Based on the
provenance—Pyramid N 11 in the
northern cemetery of Meroe—she can
be identified as Shanakdakhete. A car-
touche too damaged to read appears
at left on the almost completely worn
surface of the doorjamb.

Egypto-Sudanese border to the region between the Third
and Fourth cataracts.

The second half of the sixth millennium B.c. is
distinguished by an increasingly dry climate. The origins
and groupings of the population are difficult to
reconstruct, since hardly any well-preserved skeletal
remains have been discovered. While in Lower Nubia the
late Paleolithic lifestyle develops further, in the central
Sudan hunting and fishing recede in favor of the keeping
of domesticated animals. Oxen, goats, sheep, and dogs
are descended from wild animals not indigenous to the
Nile Valley; thus it cannot be ruled out that they arrived
in the Sudan with populations from the Sahara.
Determining the presence of agriculture is also difficult:
the meager plant remains of millet sometimes found
inside pottery jars do not differ morphologically from
wild plants. Barley, on the other hand, is attested in
domesticated form since the middle of the fifth
millennium 8.c. Indirect evidence of the cultivation of
grain is provided by the large quantity of grinding stones
for the grinding of cereals found in many sites,

PREHISTORY OF THE SUDAN

Especially noteworthy are the bell-shaped vessels. Their
non-functional, widening shape, their rarity, and their
exclusively funerary contexts all suggest a ritual
association; they were probably used in mortuary
offering ceremonies for important individuals. The
consistently smoothed or polished surfaces bear rich
decoration, usually incised with a comb-like implement.
Scratch or dotted patterns in meandering or triangular
motifs are found alongside finely striped polish (later as
“ripple ware,"" a typical surface of A-Group ceramics).
Very rarely one even finds painted vessels. The only clear
exceptions are the stone vessels. We should also mention
here the female figurines, usually of fired clay, more
rarely of sandstone, that are often explained as fecundity
idols. Their occasionally extremely formal abstraction,
which barely reveals their gender, renders their function
more puzzling.

The type of site, either habitation or cemetery,
plays a fundamental role in its interpretation. If clear
indications of a settlement are present, individual
buildings are nevertheless hardly recognizable. Only in 4
few cases have hearths been identified. Human factors,
such as subsequent overbuilding or the quarrying of
fertile, phosphate-rich soil, and natural factors, such as
water and wind erosion, have destroyed the building
structures and eliminated all trace of workshops, trash
deposits, and shelters. For this reason, the investigation
of stone-age settlements is often limited to the collection
of individual finds in square, meter-sized sections and
just a few centimeters below surface level. In the place of
paleo-ethnological methods, as practiced today in
prehistoric research, a simple typological classification
used to be the typical approach. Thus it is
understandable why the interests of the excavators
focused above all on the funerary areas, which, as closed
archaeological complexes in often undisturbed context,
provide valuable information about lifestyle, economy,
social structure, and religious conceptions.

Sites in the central Sudan

Thanks to the initiative of A. J. Arkell, the pioneer
of prehistoric research in the Sudan, the central Sudan
has become the focus of prehistoric archaeology. A
chronological framework has been established here, one
that is generally recognized today, At the beginning is

the Khartoum Neolithic, named after its principal site of
es-Shaheinab, south of the Sixth Cataract. Following this
is the cultural phase of Kadada, shaped by a drier
climate. Two sites, from which objects in the present
exhibition may be seen, will now be described in greater
detail.

Kadero, about twenty kilometers north of
Khartoum, contains an early Neolithic settlement. In the
occupants’ trash heap at the edge of the mound were
found bones of both wild and domesticated animals and
fragments of millstones, stone implements, and ceramic
vessels. The actual settlement and stalls lay in the center
of the mound, and the cemetery was nearby. The Sioa Sree :
archaeological examination of both settlement and -_— » Tomb 60 (photograph: kK, Kroeper)
cemetery of a single population group offers a unique
opportunity to portray all the aspects of the lifestyle of
this early African pastoral culture.

The means of survival consisted of raising livestock
(goats and sheep), supplemented by hunting, fishing, Fig. 6. Kadruka, Tomb 106 (photograph: Kadruka, SFDAS)
and the gathering of edible plants. Whether
domesticated grains were cultivated, or whether only
wild millet was collected, is not clear.

The cemetery of Kadero provides valuable insights
into the population structure of a Neolithic settlement.
The 160 graves thus far excavated represent just a
fraction of a cemetery that must have contained several
hundred burials. Compared to other known early
Neolithic settlements, this one reflects a considerable
population growth. Especially striking, however, is the
differentiation between a small elite group with
ostentatious burial equipment and the rest of the
population. About ten percent of the Kadero graves—
burials of men, women, and children—belong to this
group, which perhaps bequeathed its rank as ruling
family from generation to generation (fig.6).

The burial pits of these well-equipped Kadero
tombs are dug exceptionally deep. The rich grave goods
include ivory jewelry, shells from the Red Sea, malachite,
stone tools, thin-walled pottery vessels, and weapons
such as stone maceheads. The red-polished or incised
pattern clay vessels from Kadero represent a first
technological and artistic highpoint in African ceramics.
Among the other technical innovations are composite
tools, consisting of microliths set in wood to serve as
knife and sickle blades. Malachite and Red Sea shells are
luxury goods that had to be brought from great

distances, thus attesting to contact far beyond the local
territory.

Near the town of el-Kadada in the region of
Shendi, about 180 kilometers down the Nile from
Khartoum, lies a late Neolithic site from the first half of
the fourth millennium .c. The position of the cemeteries
reveals charges in social structure, most likely resulting
from new economic conditions deriving from the drying
climate. Despite the differences in the finds from the
Khartoum Neolithic, one can nevertheless see in the
many similarities sufficient evidence for the continuity of
both cultural phases,

The settlement area spreads out over 3 mound of
several hectares; the occupation in some places is over a
meter thick- All the building foundations and cultural
deposits have been destroyed by subsequent activity on
the site. THe Necropolis on the northern slope and at the

southern foot of the mound is divided into various
cemeteries. In Cemetery A, about a hundred burials were
excavated and documented; of the three thousand
graves in Cemetery C, only two hundred have been
cleared so far. The typical Neolithic grave is a simple pit,
whose removed debris was later used to cover the burial
over again. This round or oval pit, measuring from 0.8 to
two meters in diameter, shows no evidence of
architectural features, but might originally have
possessed a superstructure of perishable materials. The
constricted burials (fig. 5) were placed upon a mat but
show no particular orientation or preference for the left
Or right side.

The equipment accompanying the corpse, like the
rest of the grave’s contents, provides us with references
to the contemporary living conditions. Whether these are
gender specific cannot be determined due to the dearth

--- Page 24 ---
REMARKS ON THE

of clearly identifiable male or female skeletons. The
grave goods allow a classification of the entire range of
finds from the settlement context, but on occasion also
contain unique objects. A standard system of burial
provisions cannot be established. Stone and bone
implements are placed in the hand of the deceased; ox
horns lie beneath his or her head. All other goods are
placed around the body. The significance of this
equipment is still debated, but few would disagree that
social differentiation was represented by the variety of
equipment. We can conclude from an overview of the
burial equipment and the orientation of the graves that
an individual's position within the community is reflected
in the position of his or her grave within the structure of
the cemetery.

In comparison to the older site of Kadero,
Cemetery C at el-Kadada shows an entirely different
division. Rich and poor tombs no longer appear in
separate sections of the cemetery area. A new grave type
shows two or three burials placed one above the other,
but carefully avoiding any damage to the lowest body.
This unusual break in tradition might suggest that
human sacrifice was practiced with more important
individuals (fig. 7). The hierarchical division of society,
which began with the Khartoum Neolithic, has now in
the fourth millennium become quite conspicuous.

The somewhat later Cemetery A clearly displays
this societal change, which is sometimes called the
“Neolithic Revolution.” An unusually large number of
graves occur loosely packed together and within a very
short period. The overlap of the individual graves must
have been intentional, revealing that a single burial could
be surrounded by a dozen additional burials that cut into
and partially destroyed it. These are most likely examples
of family tombs. What is unusual is the total absence of
child burials. However, on top of the mound within the
settlement area, burials of young children were found in
large, partially destroyed ceramic vessels just below the
surface. We must therefore assume that children
younger than about six years old (the age of an initiation
rite?) were not yet considered full-fledged members of
the community, and were therefore buried outside the
cemetery, within the settlement or in its vicinity.

Between the end of the Neolithic and the
beginning of the historical period is a gap in the
archaeological record for the central Sudan. This is

PREHISTORY

probably due to the shift to nomadic pastoral agriculture,
which leaves little in the way of archaeological remains.
The family structure as the foundation of this lifestyle has
its roots in the final phase of the culture of el-Kadada.

Nubia: Kadruka and Wadi el-Khowi

Around the middle of the fifth millennium s.c.,
three Neolithic groups that practiced a predatory
economy can be identified at the Second Cataract in
Lower Nubia. Two of these seem to be of indigenous
origin, while the third probably migrated and displays
similarities to the Early Khartoum (dotted wavy line
ceramics). The local Abka culture can be traced over an
entire millennium, developing in the middle of the fourth
millennium 8.c. into the A-Group culture. It is most
unusual that despite the great Nubian archaeological
salvage campaigns of the 1960s, the Neolithic in this
region still remains unattested by either settlements or
cemeteries.

It is only above the Third Cataract, thanks to the
excavations of the past two decades, that we can see a
completely different development. By the second half of
the fifth millennium s.c. at the latest, all the fundamental
elements of Neolithic culture—the domestication of
plants and animals, the production of ceramics, and the
technique of polishing stone implements—are in
evidence. Ongoing excavations currently focus on an
area of about fifty kilometers in the Wadi el-Khowi in the
Kadruka district. In the very fertile floodplain on the east
bank of the Nile, several ancient Nile branches are still
detectable. The archaeological sites lie spread out along
these old riverbeds, and can thus be gathered into a sort
of topo-chronology. At the easternmost point of the old
riverbeds the occupation began as early as the Mesolithic
and grew in the Neolithic, thanks to the productive
agricultural soil. With the shifting of the river course to
the west, this area was abandoned; only recently has it
again become agriculturally productive, this time
through the installation of motor pumps. Unfortunately,
this development represents a tremendous threat to the
area, which can be viewed as a vast archaeological park.
At a distance of less than a kilometer from the river lies
a concentration of settlement and burial sites in the now
flat region. The few mounds left are either recent sand
drifts or the remains of old Nile islands. Very strong wind
erosion has leveled the once much higher mounds,

depositing thick sand layers between them. More than
half a meter of the original Neolithic horizon has been
destroyed; instead of contextually related structures, only
strewn remains are left. Any interpretation of the
surviving remains is therefore poorly substantiated.

The cemeteries, on the other hand, offer a
completely different picture. They lie upon mounds, and
the depth of the burial shafts has saved the tombs from
destruction. Archaeologists today have a choice of more

14

than thirty necropoli, which offer a spectacular corpus
for research. They allow us to reconstruct the
development of burial customs from the sixth to the
fourth millennium s.c. Three or four of these necropoli
possess over a thousand burials each; an average
cemetery contains one hundred and fifty. The first group
is attested over a long period; since it unites various local
grave types within its well-defined stratigraphy, it can
serve as the control for testing a chronological

--- Page 26 ---
REMARKS ON THE PREHISTORY

framework. The cemeteries of the second group are
homogenous, reflecting only a short occupation phase.
They are typical of small, closed population groups. This
is important, since for illiterate societies the mortuary
cult is one of the few forms of expression of social
stratification. Cemetery no. 1 at Kadruka provides us
with a typical example (fig. 8).

Two groups of tombs are differentiated through
their position. The grave group at the highest point of
the mound develops concentrically around a centrally
placed, particularly deep grave (no. 131). Burials in this
tomb show the rich assortment of goods typical of
higher social classes. On the slope are graves with a
larger number of female burials. The burial equipment of
the forty-year-old inhabitant of Tomb 131 is by far the
most elaborate of the period. He was doubtless the most
important individual of this community of agriculturists
and pastoralists.

Thus as early as the fifth millennium 8.c. we find
chieftains at the apex of tribal communities, an
extraordinary observation for this early period. That this
development occurs in precisely this area is certainly no
accident; in the third millennium s.c. the very first African
kingdom, the kingdom of Kerma, will arise here.

Conclusion

The Neolithic sites described above are exemplary
of the latest developments in prehistoric studies in the
Sudan. Several teams have begun in recent years to form
links with international archaeological research. Step by
step, the characteristic features are emerging for an early
civilization whose huge occupation area and
geographical situation indicate a variety of influences
and cross-references. The chronology is also slowly
coming into focus, and the early age of the earliest
Sudanese cultures lends them their particular
significance for the rise of the subsequent high
civilization in Egypt.

After several hundred thousand years without
recognizable civilizational evolution, the Neolithic
introduces fundamental and lasting changes. From the
burial customs we can determine differentiated social
structures, which in turn rapidly evolve and lead to
localized special systems. The independent cultural forms
in Nubia and the Sudan provide examples for the
evolution of independent cultures in general. Although
lacking a writing system, they are a decisive factor in the
historical development of the millennia to follow.

Discovered in the tomb of an impor-
tant individual, this sandstone figurine
is representative of the creativity and
autonomy of Sudanese Nile Valley cul-
ture from its earliest beginnings. The
abstractly rounded female form takes
on an almost mummified appearance,
enhanced by the clever use of the
grain of the sandstone. The extreme
reduction of the shape to its character-
istic silhouette is interrupted only at
the head by four horizontal lines at dif-
ferent levels, connected by very faint
vertical lines, thus forming rectangular
eyes and giving the figure its direc-
tional orientation. An incised line over
the eyes might indicate the hairline.

PREHISTORY

OF THE SUDAN

The Kadruka example differs from al
other female figurines from the prehis-
tory of the Nile Valley (cf. cats. 2-4, 31)
and later eras (for example, cats.
41-46) in its avoidance of fulsome
thighs and any plastic treatment of the
breasts. In contrast to these typical
forms of prehistoric female idols, it Is
distinguished by the linear strength of
its composition and very compact body
masses, giving it a distinctive monu-
mentality. Scholars of modern art will

see the analogy to the sculptures of
Brancusi.

in cats. 2 and 3 in the treatment of the
body. The arms are once again abbre-
viated stumps, but this time the lower
body is not merely a simple rounded
form but an anatomically precise sepa-
ration of stomach and upper thighs. In
profile, it is clear that the figure repre-
sents a pregnant woman. The lines
carved at hip level are distinct from the
tattoos all over the rest of the body.
Like the neck lines of cats. 2 and 3,
these probably represent folds of skin,
another indication of a pregnant
female. Between the shoulders, finely
incised lines indicate that the missing
head once wore a pigtail.

With its full hips, thighs, and pendu-

Meroitic ideal female form. Both hands
hold handkerchiefs ending in a sharp
point (cf. cat. 306). The bird’s wings
are treated as a single volume. The
smooth break at the neck indicates
that the head was created separately.

The stylistic quality of the numerous
heads from ba statues varies consider-
ably, but they all share a direct, frontal
gaze and a formal symmetry of struc-
ture. Many of them show a deeply
incised horizontal line on the brow
below the hairline. This is to be under-
stood either as a scarification or, if the
figure wears a wig, as the actual hair
lying underneath. A depression is visi-
ble on top of the skull for the mount-
ing of a sun-disk.

Mission Arqueologica Espafiola en Nubia,

Heroitic, second to third century AD.

Khartoum, National Museum 13365

In contrast to the large number of

heads from ba statues, this head from

the Spanish excavations at Argin forms

€n independent piece of sculpture. Its

large size is unusual, and the quality of

its workmanship exceeds that of all the

Other heads. It has no parallel in all of

Meroitic art, but shows instead a strik-

ing similarity to works created in the

Centuries surrounding the beginning of

the Christian era in the region of pre-
Sent-day Nigeria. In both the overall
facial expression and the individual
treatment of the eyes, nose, and
Mouth, the analogy is in fact so close
that a direct connection is difficult to
refute. The geographical distance
between the two regions, situated on
the same latitude on the east and west
Of the African continent, is about
2,500 kilometers. Studies of the migra-
tion patterns of central Africa are still
too sketchy to discern the route or
directional flow of this contact.
Nonetheless, the stylistic isolation of
the sandstone head from Argin, sur-
rounded there by a completely differ-
Ent artistic environment, suggests that
its inspiration—or its artist?—came
from West Africa.

A thickset hairstyle surrounds the
Spherical skull, divided into rectangular
locks above and diamond-shaped locks
at the temples and back. It extends to
just above the ears, represented by
Simple, unmodeled protrusions. A hor-
izontal line below the hair is deeply

THE KINGDOM OF

incised across the very high brow, just
below this runs a parallel but barely vis-
ible second line. The dominant facial
feature is the upper edge of the eye
sockets, indicated by deeply hollowed,
horizontal slits. Arching eyebrows are
incised just above, and the bags under
the eyes are likewise outlined by thin,
curving lines. Beneath the narrow
wedge of a nose, the small mouth is
indicated by a horizontal groove with
puffy lips. The entire effect is marked
by a restrained, linear strength in com-
plete contrast to the rounded form of
the unmodeled head and the
smoothed column forming the neck.

The head was most likely never part of
a complete statue, as is evident from
the large size and the smoothed, fin-
ished treatment of the base of the
neck, a feature found occasionally on
other Meroitic heads. Typologically, the
piece relates to portrait heads created
during the Old Kingdom in Egypt—
two and half millennia earlier—known
as “reserve heads.” But there is NO
context for associating any functional

similarity between the two types of
sculpture.

Several formal and stylistic features of
the sculpture from Argin (cat. 318)
recur on this large head from a je
tomb at Amir Abdallah: the spherica
volume, the emphasis on horizontals in
the deep undercutting of the eye-
brows, the narrow mouth with age
lips, and the column of a neck. L e
close-cropped hair is indicated by ine
curls. The rough, unfinished condition
of the bottom suggests the aneneee

The archaeological provenance of this
unique statue helps but little in dis-
cerning its date. It was discovered in a
secondary context near the enclosure
wall of the Eighteenth-Dynasty temple
at Buhen, together with a number of
objects from various periods. The head
and body are reduced to mere boxes
connected by a cylindrical neck. The
facial features are roughly incised, the
breasts are indicated by button-like
protrusions. The entire figure was
painted bright red. A broad collar with
a dotted pattern is visible, and a multi-
tiered black and red painted necklace
hangs around the neck. The hair at the
top and back of the head consists of a
pattern of black dots. The figure has
no parallels in Meroitic art, but a few
elements are reminiscent of sculptures
from South Arabia.

DIETRICH WILDUNG

Imost all the royal tombs in the necropoli of Kurru,

Gebel Barkal, and Meroe were thoroughly plun-
dered. Those few objects that have survived—forgotten,
lost, or thrown aside by the tomb robbers—provide a
dull reflection of the original splendor of the tomb fur-
nishings. One exception, however, is Pyramid N 6 of the
kandake (ruling queen) Amanishakheto in the northern
cemetery of Meroe. Like many other pyramids there, it
was still well-preserved at the beginning of the nine-
teenth century, as is shown by Frédéric Cailliaud’s draw-
ing of 1822 (cf. fig. 45). Only twelve years later, it had
become a mere pile of stones. The Italian physician
Giuseppe Ferlini, who had come to the Sudan with
Muhammad Ali's troops, leveled it, as well as many
other pyramids, in the search for treasure. But by
employing this “method,” he was spectacularly success-
ful. An apparently undisturbed golden treasure came to
light, which Ferlini immediately hustled out of the coun-
try. In a catalogue published in Italian in Bologna in
1837, followed by a French edition published in Rome in
1838, he introduced his treasure to the world and
invited buyers.

In 1839 a portion of the finds was acquired by the
royal Bavarian art collections; the remaining portion
proved difficult to sell, probably because of the unusual
style of the jewelry, which cast doubt on the authentici-
ty of the find. This doubt was only removed a decade
after Ferlini’s discovery, when Richard Lepsius, who in
1842 had recommended acquisition for the Berlin
Egyptian Museum, arrived at Meroe. He reports in his
correspondence: “Several pyramids have been complete-
ly destroyed, others only partially. None had its top pre-
served. Our kavass, who was here with Ferlini, showed
us the spot beneath a now leveled pyramid where he
supposedly found his golden treasure.” Lepsius contin-
ues: “Osman Bey (who camped with his troops in the
vicinity) wanted to make treasure hunters out of his pio-
neers, and ordered his battalions here in order to rip a
number of pyramids apart. Ferlini’s discovery sticks in

The head of Athena is carved from four
layers of different colored agate. The
Attic helm shows a chariot with two
galloping horses and the goddess Nike
in the cart. A Gorgon’s head adorns
the breast. The cameo is doubtless an
import from the Mediterranean region.

The decoration of this shield-ring from
Faras, functionally similar to the rings
of Amanishakheto, takes the form of a
miniature stela. A winged sun-disk and
wedjat eyes flanking a central sa sign

often crown the lunettes of Egyptian

Beneath the band of spheres on the
neck, three standing figures face left,
filling the entire height of the vessel
body. They follow the cubist principle
of Egyptian art in combining profile
and frontal perspective. The individual
style of the drawings, distinguished by
thin arms, frail legs, emphasis on the
hindquarters, and oversized eyes,
ascribes the vessel to the “prisoner
painter,” one of the individual artists
whose hand stands out unmistakably
from among the masses of anonymous
Meroitic vase painters. Many of his fig-
ures show.bonds drawn on the hands.
The painted double line running across
the necks of the figures here may also
represent binding ropes.

This sandstone offering basin imitates
the form and function of ceramic
examples known from a number of
sites. The central rosette is flanked by
two life (ankh) signs and in turn by
four-petaled blossoms. The motifs
resemble high, narrow bridges against

the deeply recessed background. They
are drilled through in several areas to
let water flow out of the basin. By
coming in contact with the ankh signs,
the water was magically purified.

The basin comes from the inner room
of the Lion Temple at Naga, near the
base of the god's shrine, and was used
for the cult of the lion-god Apedemak.
A similarly decorated example was
unearthed in situ directly in front of the

faience is found not only on vessels (cf.
cat. 435) but also on figural works.
This fragment from the vicinity of the
god's shrine in the inner room of the
Lion Temple at Naga shows a crouch-

explained by an additional tile from the
same location, showing a corpulent,
kneeling figure raising its arms either in
prayer or an appeal for mercy. As the

represents a royal animal in the

Hardly any find from the vicinity of the
Capital of Meroe has been so variously
interpreted as this extraordinarily well-
preserved silver goblet, found in the
ruins of Pyramid Beg. N 2 in the north-
ern cemetery. The four-figured relief
decoration shows a Roman emperor
with the features of Augustus, clad in
@ toga and enthroned on a sella
curulis. A man in a sleeveless tunic
approaches him with a lively step,
holding in his left hand an ax with a
long handle. A woman turns to both
of these figures with an appealing ges-
ture, her arms upraised; two small chil-
dren cling to her robe. Behind the
woman, the decoration concludes with
a striding man, dressed in a tunic and
hooded coat. The scene apparently
depicts the announcement of a judicial
decision. Interpreted historically, it
might show Augustus as new pharaoh
of Egypt declaring peace with the
country, personified by the woman. As
a mythological interpretation the leg-
end of Bocchoris comes to mind, and
even the theme of King Solomon as
lawgiver has been suggested.

Since the goblet shows absolutely no
Stylistic or iconographic affinity with
the Near East, Egypt, or Meroe, it is
fruitless to seek its explanation in these
regions. What is noteworthy is the sug-
gestion that the scene reproduces an
episode from a Greek tragedy.
According to Burkhalter and Arce, the
Scene represented is the judgment of

Although the modeling of the two
faces differs, these two bronze heads
doubtless form a pair. They were cast
by means of the lost wax method in
two pieces, soldered together at the
area of the diadem. This technique
provided for the easy application of the
eye inlays from the inside out. The gap
at the neck fitting, appearing right-
angled in profile view, allowed for the
attachment of the heads to statues
whose height can be reconstructed to
about seventy-five centimeters. Several
elements clearly identify them as repre-
sentations of the Greek god Dionysos:
the locks of hair gathered in braids the
floral diadem over the brow, the head-
band (of red copper with silver inlays)
and the full, youthful facial features,
According to C. Vermeule, the siete
type may be traced to the work of
Praxiteles. Owing to the existence of
two such heads, it is doubtful that they
were intended to stand alone as sepa-
rate statues. More likely they stood
together in a functional context that
required a statue pair. They probably
served as lamp stands, part of the valu-
able, imported luxury goods decorat-
ing the royal palace.

Post-Meroitic, fourth to fifth century A.
Khartoum, National Museum 26291

For the continuity of the Meroitic king-
dom in the fourth and fifth century
A.D., the most important site is el-
Hobagi, situated not far from Wad Ban
Naga on the left (west) bank of the
Nile. Instead of the pyramid form, the
traditional tumulus reappears, now
surrounded by a large temenos wall.
Although these are usually seen as typ-
ically post-Meroitic complexes, the
burial equipment found in the el-
Hobagi tombs indicates just the oppo-
site. Their inventory is strictly Meroitic;
hence the fall of the city of Meroe and
its royal cemetery is not delineated by
any sharp, historical break. The conti-
nuity of Meroitic culture extends into 453
the fourth and fifth centuries A.D.

An inscription in Meroitic hieroglyphs

mentioning the words “king” and 5 LO VinuDisav? Vashi

""god"" appears on this bronze bowl rr er ar re
from Tumulus Ill. This is the latest ‘ % ; BS A, A ade

The bell-shaped vessels from el-
Kadada show definite Stylistic develop-
ments over their counterparts from
Kadero (cat. 5). The body has become
thinner, the mouth broader. The com-

pact, stocky form of the earlier Kadero
cups is replaced by an elegant, soaring
outline. The striped dot pattern, pro-
duced by impressing a comb-like
implement, covers the upper and
lower thirds of the exterior, leaving free
a smoothly polished central area. A tri-
angular pattern adorns the interior of
the rim. All the decoration is filled with

he great political, religious, and architectural

changes that swept Egypt following the conquest of
Alexander the Great and subsequent Roman rule did not
fail to affect her neighbor to the south as well. These
external influences contributed to the already existing
geographical, geological, climatic, and cultural factors
significant for construction techniques in the Sudan. The
synthesis of the indigenous and the foreign has resulted
in the individuality of Meroitic architecture and legit-
imized the stylistic term “Meroitic.” Tradition and exter-
nal influence, local and alien elements were all combined
in both practical/utilitarian and artistic/creative endeavors
to determine the function, construction, and form of
buildings. Since architecture is not a product for an
unknown market, but depends rather on local private or
societal order, we can value the art of building in the
kingdom of Meroe as a visible expression of the lifestyles
and social surroundings of the inhabitants—even if it
was destined only for a limited segment of society.

Secular architecture

Recent population estimates for the region of the
kingdom of Kush in its heyday suggest about five hun-
dred thousand inhabitants. These individuals, adminis-
tered more or less from Meroe, consisted mostly of
dwellers along the two banks of the Nile engaged in
agricultural activities. For large segments of the popula-
tion simple reed huts or shelters in the fields dressed with
matting’ were the only available protection against the
elements. In addition to these there were more massive
dwellings of unbaked brick, rectangular in plan, that
offered, along with a certain degree of comfort in the
form of two or three rooms, more durable protection.

For the more elite classes there were even larger
house complexes in which we can recognize distinct liv-
ing, reception, and economic areas, with a court in front.
In these complexes, a mixture of various construction

MEROITIC ARCHITECTURE

techniques is in evidence, for example, mud brick along
with stone slabs and rubble or combined with one- or
two-sided brick facing. Settlements at centers of trade or
administration developed along the lines of town plan-
ning. During the late Meroitic Period in Lower Nubia, the
settlement of Karanog, with its estimated surface area of
six to eight hectares (sixty to eighty thousand square
meters), probably a provincial capital and containing
some three to four thousand residents, is particularly
noteworthy. But an accurate picture of the street plans
and inner city layout cannot be gleaned from the town
plan of the original excavators. The structure of the set-
tlement seems distinguished by narrow, irregular, wind-
ing streets between two- and three-story houses with
mud-brick walls and partially vaulted roofs.2 Three-story
houses for an elite (governor?), encompassing a floor
area of about 650 square meters each, are designated as
palaces or “castles.”

In Upper Nubia, there is evidence of larger settle-
ments during the Meroitic Period worthy of the term
“town.” Among these are Kawa, with an area of seven-
teen hectares and about seven to eight thousand inhab-
itants, and the capital, Meroe, with about fifty hectares
within its purview, containing the royal city, temples,
workshops, streets, and squares. At its height, perhaps
about twenty to twenty-five thousand residents lived
here (fig. 47).3 However, the information gained from
excavations of 1910-144 is meager and provides no sat-
isfactory understanding of the residential and palace
architecture,

A better example is provided by the ruins located
further south at Wad Ban Naga, a town with several
temples and the residence of Queen Amanishakheto
(about 10 8.c.-0; fig. 48). The remains of the ancient set-
tlement (1000) are assumed to lie under the fields to the
east of the present-day railroad line. On its east side, two
long hills of broken brick and worked stone chips

delineate the position of the “Typhonium” (200) and the
Isis temple (300). A few meters away lie the ruins of the
queen's palace (fig. 49). The square building structure
(100), with its sixty-one-meter-long sides, covers about
3,700 square meters, and is thus one of the largest
Meroitic secular structures. Only the ground floor, con-
sisting primarily of mud-brick walls with sixty rooms,
entrance halls, inner ramps, and long magazines often
sealed from above, has survived the millennia under a
mound of debris.5 In the center of the upper floor lay an
open court—known from other buildings to take the

form of an atrium—around which the additional rooms
were grouped. The columns and capitals of the upper
peristyle had collapsed and were found fallen on the
ground floor.

On the eastern side of the upper floor, with its
reception areas and living quarters, one passed over a
twenty-one-meter-long ramp leading into the atrium,
similar to the identically sized Palace 1500 at Gebel
Barkal. Ramps in the interior linked the entrance halls in
the south and west with the upper floor. The western
gate opened onto an enclosed court chamber which

apparently linked the residence to the two temples. At
the east lay a small temple (400) at some distance in
front of the palace and, a hundred and fifty meters fur-
ther away, the Amun Temple (500).

We should certainly include the so-called royal
bath at Meroe (95, 194, 195) among the corpus of sec-
ular buildings. But the surviving elements of this struc-
ture, which betray a certain Ptolemaic-Roman influence
from the north, defy a realistic architectural analysis.

Military constructions form their own architectural
class, as can be seen in the two fortified sites of Hosh el-
Kab and Gebel Marrahi, with four-cornered bastions and
a ground plan of three double-rectangles in a proportion
of 8:5 (el-Kab) or a square (Gebel Marrahi). To this group
also belong the forts of Kubinat and el-Fura, as well as
the partially structured town wall of Meroe or that of
Dangeil. The city wall of Meroe, over a thousand meters
in length, ranged between 3.55 and 4.15 meters thick,
and may have stood that high as well.

The great Meroitic waterworks belong more
under the heading of engineering structures rather than

396

architecture. Nevertheless, mention must be made here
of the more than eight hundred hafirs (fig. 50). The
largest of these water catch-basins, dating to the third
and second centuries 8.c., have an average distance from
crest to crest of up to 250 meters (Awlib, Basa,
Musawwarat 51, Umm Usuda), and the Hafir Meroe 256
reached 183 meters (fig. 60; cf. also fig. 62 for MUS 51).
Large frog sculptures once ritually attracted the waters,
while lion figures took on apotropaic functions. Recent
investigations have sought to explain the hafir construc
tions in terms of economic factors and political expan-
sion of the Meroitic hinterlands, rather than the
influence of climatic fluctuations.”

Religious architecture

|. Temples

In the Sudan, the political changes in Egypt at the
beginning of the third century 8.c. are reflected especial-
ly strongly in the area of religious architecture. If we look
at the building activity in the Sudanese Nubian Nile Valley
in the preceding eras, we notice that the large temples

to the gods® and other significant works? either date to
the Twenty-fifth Dynasty or—as in the case of the Amun
Temple at Gebel Barkal (500)—achieved their final form
at that time. By contrast, the activities in the following
three hundred and fifty years, aside from the even more
ambitious mortuary complexes at Nuri, were much more
modest. Between 650 and 300 s.c. we find a dearth of
construction on new temple buildings. Perhaps the
emphasis at this time lay on alterations and completions
of already existing monuments, rather than on new
structures.'° This situation may have resulted from the
need for repairs following the destruction caused by the
expedition of Psametek Il (595-589 B.c.), from the need-
ed maintenance work on temples threatened with dete-
rioration over the preceding two to four centuries, or
from the relocation of the royal court to Meroe.
Whatever the cause, the moving of the capital improved
the conditions for the construction of temples to the
indigenous deities. From this point onward, the temples
for Egyptian gods had to share the building resources
with temples for Meroitic deities. The focal point of

397

construction activity shifted southward to Meroe and the
surrounding region.

Temples for Egyptian Gods

The axial orientation of the Amun temples, with
court and hypostyle as festival rooms, followed by
pronaos, barque room, and cult statue chamber as divine
apartments, is retained.'' The incompletely excavated
Amun Temple at Meroe (MER 260; fig. 51) provides an
example of such a ground plan (fig. 52). It appears to
have been built in two separate phases, with the west-
ern half arising in conjunction with or soon after the con-
struction of the wall of the royal city (or a predecessor
wall thereof).'2 In the first building phase there followed
behind a pylon a court roofed on both sides (270), a hall
of appearances (273), a pronaos (269), and a barque
room (261), ending finally with the cult statue chamber.
The rooms to the north and south—except for the
throne hall (266)—were probably magazines and side
chambers, The measurements taken for some of the
rooms reveal clear, harmonic proportions. The area of the

Cidcsied : eroe. Moreover, the other Meroitic temples
© Amun are also smaller, measuring at Naga

398

(100), for example, about seventy cubits for the actual
temple building (fig. 54).

A second, smaller temple type was also devised
during the Meroitic Period. Its sanctuary area terminated
in three chambers, as shown in Temple 200 at Naga
(fig. 55). In front of these were two chambers, of which
the first, with two columns or, in special cases in some
temples, four (BAR 1300, BAR 1400) or even eight (WAD
BAN NAGA 500), is reminiscent of the hypostyle hall.
The second chamber, corresponding to the pronaos, was
smaller and contained either no columns or just two
(BAR 1300, BAR 1400). Noteworthy are the interrelated
proportions in relations of 1:1 and 8:5, which produce 4
linear extension in a proportional tripartition. The temple
of Naga dates to late Meroitic times and thus displays
exterior proportions typical of Meroitic temple architec-
ture, instead of the harmonic interior proportions
favored in Egyptian temples. 14

Likewise, the structures BAR 700-sec, NAGA 500,
and MER 720 are all Meroitic Period monuments dedi-
cated to the god Amun. Also built for Egyptian gods
were the so-called Typhonium and the temples dedicat-
ed to the goddess Isis (300) in Wad Ban Naga, and addi-
tional temples to the same goddess in Musawwarat
(800) and Meroe (600 a, b).

For all these monuments we can conclude that
the chamber measurements followed symmetrical, har-
monic interior proportions. Furthermore, our investiga-
tions so far indicate that temples for Egyptian gods,
unlike their counterparts built for indigenous deities,
were constructed using the Egyptian cubit as measuring
unit.

Temples for native gods

In contrast to temples for the gods of Egypt,
which consist of a long series of chambers strung
together, temples dedicated to Meroitic deities con-
tained only one or two chambers, with or without a
pylon. The earliest independent forms for a Meroitic type
of one-roomed temple may derive from the carefully pro-
portioned chapels in front of the tumuli at Kerma,'® the
buildings Barkal 700.sub.1 and sub.2, and Barkal 900.

To this building type belong, for example, the
temples at Musawwarat (300, 1000), Naga (300, 500,
700), Tabo (300), Wad Ban Naga (400), Matruka, and
Murabba, as well as the temples with subsequently

added peripteral rows of columns'é in Tabo (200), Naga
(400, 800), Basa (100), and Gebel Hardan.

Many of these temples are associated with the
worship of the lion-god Apedemak. A few with pre-
served inscriptions and reliefs dedicated to this god serve
to distinguish other buildings of similar type. An example
of a lion temple, besides the one in Musawwarat
(1000),'7 is the recently explored temple 300 at Naga
(fig. 56). This monument!8 rests on a plinth and is ori-
ented to the southeast. A richly decorated Vitruvian por-
tal'9 and chamber gate in a 6.5-meter-high pylon leads
to a single room whose roof is supported by wooden
girders resting on four columns. Sandstone from a near-
by quarry provided the material for all load-bearing and
room-defining elements. The two pairs of columns divide
the room unequally, allowing for a larger area in the rear
section for a wooden shrine whose carefully worked sup-
port of carved stone has survived. Both exterior and inte-
rior wall surfaces of the temple bear reliefs which were
originally finished with lime plaster,2° pigments, metal,

399

and stone inlays. The exterior walls terminated in cavet-
to cornices. The exterior pylon and building corners taper
to the wall surfaces at eighty-six or eighty-seven degrees,
forming sharply angled borders and, together with the
frieze of stars, mirroring frames that encompassed the
reliefs.

Special care was taken with the measuring and
laying out of the monument. The basic unit of measure-
ment was the module (M), derived from Greek architec-
ture, rather than the cubit used for the temples
dedicated to Egyptian gods. The module used for the
Lion Temple as the lower diameter of the columns mea-
sures about 65 centimeters. The pylon thus covered an
area of 16 M x 2 M. Its width and height bore the har-
monic proportion of 8:5 (fig. 57). The length of 16 M
was also used for the exterior measurement of the mon-
ument behind the pylon. This resulted in an overall pro-
portional figure of 1:1. The width of the structure
developed out of two harmonious 8:5 rectangles and
bore 13 M. The interior room displayed with its

contrast to the “free” form of cat. 25.
Although produced, like all Neolithic

The roughly rectangular palette is con-

its surface was used for grinding. In
some tombs, palettes were found with
traces of malachite or galena, materials
used for eyepaint. Malachite was also
employed for coloring teeth.

CHARLES BONNET

A rchaeological interest in Nubia began as early as
the start of the century, when the American
Egyptologist George A. Reisner carried out digs along
the Nile upstream from Aswan, pinpointing and record-
ing the sites threatened by raising the height of the dam.
This research was begun at the request of Gaston
Maspero, director general of the Egyptian Antiquities
Service at the time. Reisner drew up a first classification
of Nubian cultures, which he categorized using letters of
the alphabet; these have been retained for Groups A, C,
and X.1

The A-Group culture, which has its origins in the
rich Neolithic tradition of Nubia and probably in the
Egyptian Nagada culture as well, created considerable
interest among researchers during the international cam-
Paign to safeguard the sites and monuments of Nubia
(1960-69).2 On the one hand, it appears to have been
Organized in small chieftaincies or principalities from the
middle of the fourth millennium e.c., at a crucial point in

A-GROUP AND PRE-KERMA

the formation of the Egyptian state. On the other hand,
it probably served as an intermediary between Egypt and
the regions further south, and was perhaps involved in
mining resources in the eastern desert. Three chronolog-
ical phases have been distinguished: the ancient phase (c.
3700-3250 B.c.), the classical phase (c. 3250-3150 8.c.),
and the final phase (c. 3150-2800 8.c.).

Although the research and excavations carried out
in the Nubian campaign have allowed us to piece
together the major lines of the population of Lower
Nubia during the A-Horizon, the same cannot yet be said
for the territory between the Second and Fourth
cataracts.4 More recent research carried out at Kermaé
and Kadruka,§ upstream from the Third Cataract, indi-
cates that there were people there around 3000 s.c. In
the present state of research, we prefer to call them pre-
Kerma: the geographical location is very different end
the ceramic style, although related to that of A-Group, is

not exactly comparable; in addition, Egyptian imports are
Practically nonexistent.

This pre-Kerma Culture could also partly fill the

i (c. 2800-2400 8.C.). The data gathered suggest,

PREHISTORY OF THE SUDAN

Fig. 10. A-Group tomb types (after W. Adams)

Several superimposed burials in a single pit could,
as in Neolithic times, mean human sacrifices, but this
hypothesis remains to be confirmed. The organization of
the cemeteries, the shape of the tombs, and the kinds of
materials found therein suggest that there was a certain
hierarchy in the society. A few prestigious items stand
out, which could only have been the prerogative of
chiefs, such as the maces from Sayala with the handle
covered in gold and decorated with animals,” or the
stone vase from Qustul, whose engraved decoration is
unusual because of its very special iconography.8 A-
Group settlements seem to have been small in size and
composed mainly of huts or other flimsy constructions. A
larger grouping has been uncovered at Afyeh, where the
houses were made from stones bound with alluvium and
had several rectangular rooms. This site probably corre-
sponds to a chieftaincy’s headquarters.2 At Khor Daud,
over five hundred silo-pits dug into the earth have been
uncovered. In them were storage vessels, most of which
came from Egypt.'9 It is likely that there was a settlement
here or in the immediate vicinity, as was the case at

Kerma.

On the latter site, in fact, the area where similar
silo-pits lay was surrounded by circular huts with a diam-
eter of 4.3 to 4.7 meters. Only one building was rectan-
gular in shape. There were many intercuttings in the
series of post-holes. An extremely rare find was also

--- Page 48 ---
A-GROUP AND PRE-KERMA

made here: deep excavations have revealed a stratified
area with a hearth and material, which is being studied.
To date, a hundred and eighty pits have been recognized
as such, with several showing signs of rubefaction and
Only three still containing jars in situ.""!

The arm of the Nile where this settlement was
located probably dried up in the first half of the third mil-
lennium B.c., causing the site to be abandoned. A survey
carried out along the dead river branch has revealed
scatters of artifacts over several kilometers, signaling that
there must have been other similar settlements whose
structures have disappeared due to the combined effects
of wind erosion and washing of the soil. No very charac-
teristic pre-Kerma tomb has been discovered. A few buri-
als excavated at Kadruka probably also belong to this
pre-Kerma occupation. Little or no equipment was
found.

The Nubian pottery of A-Group, like pre-Kerma
work, stands apart fairly clearly from contemporary
Egyptian production,12 especially in the way the surface
is treated, often being perfectly polished and decorated
with a wide variety of geometric designs inspired by bas-
ketwork. Shapes are above all represented by basins,
bowls, cups, and neckless jars, all handmade. There are
a great number of red wares with black mouths and inte-
riors. Characteristic of A-Group production are wares
with a rippled outer surface (rippled ware), which are red
with black mouths, and pottery in a very fine light brown
Nile silt, covered with a geometric design painted in dark
red (eggshell or variegated hematitic ware).13 Pre-Kerma
pottery is being classified, which will of course facilitate
comparisons with A-Group production, but also with the
final Neolithic production of central Sudan'4 or with that
of the culture at Omdurman, near Khartoum.!5

Neolithic (cat. 4) and A-Group (cat. 31)
traditions. Innovations typical of the C-
Group include the abbreviated, stumpy
arms, the additions of a belt and neck-

The latter was worked separately and
placed on top of the pointed neck.
