### Background 

*describe Sudan Conflict here, potentially borrow language from Brittany's Report or ask Brittany to proofread for accuracy*
- RSF has occupied Khartoum and the National Museum since July 3, 2023.

### Looted Antiquities

On 21 March 2025, SAF reclaimed Khartoum, including the airport, presidential palace, and museums, according to international media outlets such as *The Guardian* and the *Associated Press*. In early April, the Sudanese National Corporation for Antiquities, or NCAM, released images and videos documenting extensive looting in the Sudan National Museum, SNM. 

C4ADS received additional information from a Sudanese on-the-ground source that members of the RSF had also looted other cultural and historical museums in RSF-occupied areas. These include the Beit Al-Mahdi Museum and the War Museum, as well as local museums in other RSF-occupied states, such as the Nyala City Museum in South Darfur. Among the stolen items were "stone statues, leather, bronze, iron and wooden artifacts, wall paintings, weapons, sculptures, utensils, decorative tools and others, representing the different periods of Sudanese civilization from the Stone Age to prehistory." 

According to our source, RSF members sold an unknown proportion of the looted artifacts to finance their activites. Buyers and members of the RSF smuggled these antiquities through the Darfur states and into Chad and South Sudan. As of mid-April, small artifacts were still circulating for sale in Sudan-Chad border areas. Other artifacts were listed for sale via online peer-to-peer marketplace platforms such as eBay or Etsy.
